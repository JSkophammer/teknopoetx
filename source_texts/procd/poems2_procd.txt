POEMS
































Here take this
it's for you
to have so
be gentle
now please don't
say I need
it for myself
To live as if
For me your …

… is not enough

* * *





















One night I drifted lifeless to a lake
or maybe just the mirror of a dream
The moon whispered my name
and pulled me in her arms
She swore another kiss would be my last

* * *



























It comes without warning I
never see the whirlwind
Then it strikes
Twisting me around in dark
Confused thoughts I standing back
see myself and wonder who is this
face that always follows
me around
This name that stakes its claim on me
Absurd!
What trick has played deceptive
Games to coax me to this I
Laugh at the surreal way
I take me for myself I think
The mirror is to blame

* * *

















Come here
come closer
please listen
I have
something to tell you

yes this
moment
please
"You must never forget …

and if you do then
You
will finally see

* * *


















When all else seems
out of reach just
Call me
with your golden voice
I'll meet you here
in paradise!

* * *


























A rose of blossom flames do you now feel
A whispered warmth? thick fragrant chanting those
Soft kisses cutting in sweet fatal strokes
Let blood of letting go open the door
Let wind invade outside let branches dance
Not asking where it comes from where it goes
The wind will hide behind us sailing out
Of sight or drifting into silence drawn
By chains of siren calls engraved on page
That word it speaks in caves by dying fires
Still moving us behind each mask do you
still see the mirrored apple from the tree
that falls and falls and rolls into the field
Only to be devoured by a rose?

* * *


















If I had the will
I'd make this lever move
A world or two or not
more than mine
if I had to choose
just one

* * *


























Bright was day-break golden before the cloud-fall
under shades dark cold by the icy skin now
Withering quick I for a moment break down
shattered by your call!

* * *




























As you well know
it's hard enough
For half a bird
to walk
Let alone fly
but now
That we have
each other
Let's go
to the highest branch
Of that tall tree to watch
at last the sunrise
together

* * *



















I do but
If only you
could see yourself
Through my eyes
in just one glance
You would see
your fondest doubts
drift away

* * *
























They fall
for
miles
and land
in a pool
Pulled
down
a drain
now
Out from my way
yet
not from …

* * *




















Countless raindrops found us here but wait
let's watch them fill the air and
fall
see those drops by the window they
dart
in shifting rhythms on the deck down
a shallow pool of water gathers there
upon the tabletop drop by drop
they reach the pool then die
Spreading into waves
to let us see the melody of rain
stand with me here in this
shower wept of dark clouds
risen from ground
flowers grass and trees and …
of water all us made
will rest again as land or sea
returning every drop
hold out your hand
no no don't try to hold them
let them slide through your fingers
one day they will be
lifted by the sun to reunite
in a shapeless cloud at last to share
a deep embrace preparing to
Fall again to drop
down
full of weightless joy
are you …

* * *



Still trees shed the last
Drops of downpour blades
Of emerald grass glisten each
crystal bead magnifies
reflects the whole
warmly risen sun the pure
Powder blue sky
open-armed embraces
us storm-battered below
While morning-birds raise woven
harmonies those hopeful
hymns of praise ecstatic.

* * *




















Please just forgive
(once more)
drop my faults

my dearest
heart keeps your
locked gold mine
love always
Safely inside

… don't leave!

* * *





















I was so hungry that night
that cold October night
when you told me about him
my stomach tied itself in knots
not that I cared about you
and him
together
(not that it matters now)
not that I loved you … ever
not even for a second
don't flatter yourself!
I never think of you
anymore
or that night
you failed to break my heart

* * *

















I'm sure you know I've dreamed this day
When I'd speak and you'd listen in silence
Ready at last you'll hear the cold truth without
raising a hand at me
those days are gone
Now a bright sun breaks past the horizon
blinding me with piercing light to bury
dark and bitter comfort our night

* * *
























See that —
in the oak
a lark
placed the last
twig of
Her new home
for Now

* * *

























A slow rope winds
of space and time
To knit this net
a grid of not
Now someone please untime me!

* * *



























Being a rock
jagged
stuck
so close
to shore so
long is
tough

to know just
a quick kick
or an earthquake
could shake me from
this spot is
hard

until that day
waiting I
patiently dream
Of being a stone rolled smooth in your stream

* * *













At last at last! again
the open door
I step inside
I'm blinded
As this gentle heat
tickles to my heart
Trembling rolling rushing through me
Leaving me so breathless so
ecstatic!
Melodies of praise erupt my soul
Tears wash my face
my spirit glides to sing
Your touch so merciful
Your glance so mesmerizing
Your flood of love so powerful I'm swept into your arms!

* * *

















I stand now (as
always)
On the shore
Between firm ground
I've walked
Past and this limitless
ocean before me
While light gently
opens my eyes
and
wakes my skin
as
wave after wave
Wash my feet clean
and
bury me deeper
in this moment o p e n

* * *















Light pyramid surrounding me a shield
Deflecting darkness cast in the abyss
Center shaking light erupts
His mighty sword descends
I burst in flames a thousand beams are spread
A voice says It is done
we have been freed!
At last those chains are gone
for God is great!
Praise in ancient tongues fall from my lips
A voice from long ago just now released
His words sweep through my mouth O God how long
Has my soul been a captive to the dark?
O who cares? Father I'm home now Home!

* * *


















But if you wait
if you wait
How will she ever see
This gift (such a gift!) how
will she know when
Will she ever know
walking still
Walking
ice-steps upon
the sun

* * *






















At every point the center
encompassing each drop
below the span of left to right
we fill a wall-less cup

* * *




























I see the sun and laugh
To think I used to see
so much beauty ha! but how
hideous it is beside
your love that warm flash your eyes

* * *



























(I ≤ Other) For what is love
But self -
Sacrifice the offering
of blood
as wine
The willful
submission of will
for the sake
Of the beloved as leaves
fall
And return
to their ground
for the sake
Of later seasons
living off the passed
(Other ≤ I)
Where is the line? we divide
drop from ocean drop
+ wave from wave
+ them from Us
+ yours from Mine
= what?
plots of land divided
By lines unseen
phantoms of thought
(0 ∙ ∞ = 1) = I — nnocent to ants

* * *






I look into her eyes
her arrows fly
and strike my heart
and disassemble m e

* * *




























Holding her child
Their glances embrace stars stilled
at midnight shared fire

* * *





























Looking up
into the stars
I connect those specks
of light
Revealed in
emptiness
Into letters or
words
Into a pearl necklace
a starfish or
Petals in the wind
into …

You give me enough stars
And I'll connect them
into any thing
even a portrait
of …

Looking up into the stars

* * *












This polished glass soft mirrored leaves
reflects the sum of all
a beauty unsurpassed unseen
Surrounds while dancing still

* * *




























As sleep began to fade away
a mild dew of silken dreams
long bent the beams of dawning day
and the song of murmuring streams
in wild woods with no clear bound
embraced within a sacred ground
With pale frost across my skin
I wondered where would I begin
I called but no one heard the call
an echo moved throughout the realm
and danced around from elm to elm
persuading every leaf to fall

She watched the wind blow through the trees
releasing her from painful memories

* * *

















But for now we are
Here still under the bright moon
do you hear the soft …?

* * *





























A butterfly on my tongue born
Has flown away from me
without a farewell glance he left
To join his family
as soft notes fly a lonely flute
afraid of following
remains in silence absolute
Unfathomable dream

* * *
























Just to the east of Tanzamir
Name lost he conjures up a time
to mountain down the sky to hear
a melody of stars
To darkness blind a fire
stirs dead wind inside his cave
where skeletons awake
with dusty bones still fit to dance
Amused to brood a soothing harp
Like butterflies unleashing notes
Sparkling by the sunshine in his ear
Upon the altar of his voice
Sacrificing words to praise
that vision of sweet Tanzamir

* * *


















Beauty almost blinding
pulls my eyes
with warm golden thread
gently pulls them up
to see
to stun
The moment
hands raised
to the altar …
Rest again
my dear
rest
but in the morning when
you arise
Would you please brush
my face awake
again

* * *















To golden hills afar
we walk unseen
memory a better frame
embraces home
Fields laced with lilies glazed
feed off the sun

* * *


























At last those long cold nights have passed the snow
Still lingering slow-fades into the ground
for thirsty seeds to drink and drink below
the surface stirs a wind awoken now
a mighty tempest raises up the dead
Have given up their temples for the light
That fills the ground with words still left unsaid
Engraved into the east and west to let
the tulip catch a breath of sun? unfold
each petal one by one? a fragrance spreads
and drifts across the fields to infuse
The song of every bird that floods the space
with their unbridled melodies whose bed
Is emptied by those blazing trumpets cold?

* * *


















Up lift dove-petaled wings
angel crowns aloft
they dance in wind
ballet in silence
were we brought here to watch?

long willows droop and dip
their frail fingers through
the dark pond mirror
echoes of a swan
caress spread across smooth

ascend
when to she
dropped her wings

* * *

















ascends
dove
A
Chain in his beak
Broke
mid-air
falling
I'm
free!

* * *























Go ahead make your home in the divine
tear the temple veil
feast atop the golden altar
your golden altar!
Breathe in the sacred flames
And light each candle with a kiss
Live inside our ancient paradise
And of its beauty sing!
Now open all the scrolls
find your name on every page
know your name is so precious in heaven
Gaze into the glistening mirror
Float into the eyes of eternal love
Listen! Do you hear the angels whispering?
Listen to their silent words
you are so precious to them
Dance through the valley of shadows
Toss away all the fears you've held
Your steps will be guided by our Beloved!
Do you hear the joyous choir singing
Praising the Sun for its boundless love?
Have you found that ancient treasure
that priceless gift from our Beloved?

When sacred music strikes your ears
Fresh flowers will suddenly bloom
Lilies and tulips and orchids and roses
a joyous garden will arise
I promise you
when you want to hear such blissful melodies
Just look to the wind that blows in trees and stars!

* * *

Late for the dinner plate
plan my escape
Dark dive through forests
dense mangled limbs
shred the shadows empty night
(That beast holds stars shimmering
in its ruthless claws)
I pause

vacant winds move swiftly leaves
Open proud void filled with phantoms

caught by a laughing sphinx
catatonic lost
All in a dazed work I
Grab my plastic shackles
glad by my binding
I'm alive

* * *














Painted mask laughing
who forgot to flip the switch?
dancing with blue mice

* * *





























Long before this road
I dreamed of nothing
more than to become
An astronaut to
see the world below
Floating still inside
The spacecraft weightless
with stars around me
Looking down with life
as I once knew it
there untouchable

Did I want escape?
Or just to see this
From a new angle?

Looking back at then
from the height these years
have lifted me up
I see myself then
From a new angle
From
here now I float

* * *









A poppy seed invisible
begins to shine a light
Held fused inside a gentle bliss
we eagerly await

A wind is stirred mysterious
a breath incalculable
each sacred life is spoken once
in joyful syllables!

* * *























Pale moonlight singing
Velvet streams of soft stillness
the mirror dissolves

* * *





























Released by breath this amber oil loosed
They try to climb hold slip but fall they fade
Back into silence resting waters wait
I see the mirrored sunlight beaming whose
warm embrace is halted when the clouds
begin to gather lost away they drift
I chase the roaring fire burning woods
and dance along the precipice a cliff
is tempting me to overstep to fly
with angels soaring by me wing to wing
or as a feather right here and now
drop
a gentle finger fails to allow
my hands and feet to move (or so I think)
Who stills the thunder of a whispered call?

* * *

















Here we are sitting
close to but not next
to one another
now waiting to fly
off together but
not together we
haven't even met
nor will we ever
meet but don't worry
this is no lament
no false despair for
our disconnected
life for I want no
more than myself now
and always alone
in this unfettered
solitude free of
demands to meet to
fail to meet you so
we must wait here close
yet never further
as we prepare to
fly away from here

* * *









Unseen eyes from this needle take
from this moment
cut the threat
for there or knot
for here nor that
for fear rears slith-or-serpen says
As ripples rest the pondal surface shine
reflex of shadows still
Considering the day
and night
revolving yarn
and quilt-works her ethereal return

* * *




















To segregate the day
the night until we see
such visions on the outside glass
Reflect eternity

* * *




























Right here not me it lives inside the wind
that moves me like a kite without a thread
to hold my words
in place they dance in flight
With golden wings they soar across my head
where is the ground?
I'm spun around in clouds
that lift me high above the little peaks
of snow-capped
mountaintops
the trumpets loud
and full of joy they greet me now once weak
now strengthened by the life it stirs within
and reawakens every limb
from death
The frost is melting now warmed by the sun
could this cold winter
finally be done?
a thousand prayers
are answered just one left
As blinding light is breaking through my skin

* * *











I dip my cup so deep in stream
to fill it faithful full
From some old water source unseen
whose spring is always still

A mother pregnant giving birth
To children in the stars
within the quiet universe
a vision (flash!) appears

* * *























A lotus flower bright unfolds
a thousand petals arms
stretched and stretched to grab the sun
the source with hopeless limbs

left floating utterly relaxed
the fish patrol the deep
By sworn oaths solemn they protect
the lotus to the drop

* * *























This paradisiac diffuse
with one quick breath inhale
into hypnotic velvet mist
to spread fast every vein
or branch a course by every cell
with gentle lightning streams

* * *


























In aftermath of moments to enshrine
in fragmentary pictures hold a breath
unlifted from the future reconceive
those may-be sacrificial altared left
To demonstrate the bondal draw of blood
Or love beyond the marrow-bone infuse
no space to slice for memories unfade
When watered by the here-now light to trace
returning to the ever-turning daze
to home to wake eat drink sleep breathe again
to work the routine hands and feet to move
to walk along the unred carpet rolled
up and out the way to unforget
is sunshine on my rainbow-meadowed day

* * *


















Piped within a dream a song
To music me away
timed within a time too long
To lightning visions fade
to silence they confide
Bewildered on the upside down now
broken in the play

* * *

























Raise a glass with me let's drink!
this delicious poison to the night
and wink at each malicious star
That prowls the darkness when
The sun is out
of sight and mind we feast on shadows cold
And decorate the moments of our crime
And shrink in fear to watch our fates unfold
in prophecies that blazing sun foretold

* * *























Keep walking there is nothing
to see there yes keep walking
Don't look at him don't think of
him just keep passing him I'm
almost there just look ahead
Don't look down don't give him some
food or change nobody wants
change not him at least wait! what
are you doing? don't give him
a dollar? five dollars?! you
must think you're a saint you must
feel so good making us look
bad how selfish of you now
I can't pretend to ignore
Pretend not to notice him
and everyone watching me
to see what I'll do now I'll
show you false martyr everyone
will see this ten dollar bill
This small token
of generosity
this irrefutable
Proof of benevolence
or humanity
take this
here!

* * *






Here is dark and cold there
Is nothing for me to dream
Without rainbows perfumed to dust
Delirium from this liquid lens
To magnify the falling sand there
Is nothing to do but wait
if nothing more should rise
Through this to the warmth above
Here to the raining light I see
by cataracts of self impose
That glimmer of a tree

* * *





















I hurt the ones I love the most I know
they don't need my pain with them I share
the weight so cruel of my ill deeds
to lift
the heavy heavy burden of my guilt
this anger at myself
Too much to bear on my back so it turns
into a shape that seems to me more just
To cast on those I love the most I know
Just how much I hurt that much I will
Be forgiven this time
and the next

* * *




















I have no great pain but I desperately love
to sing about no wounds ignoring each moment
except those self-inflicted tragedies I see
over and over I unable or unwilling
return to the rash to help or relieve I
scrape my nails off waiting to awake
my undead fingers glad to dispense with death
to slave my time until I bursting into rapture
climb out the grave

* * *























Within the skin ice to unmelt
or mint until first last resort
for traces faint left to convert
Watching time unfold dark vision bright
And inside drip pain made of art

* * *



























On this display old daisies rest the vase
drops tears of mystery slow falling fears
a pool around the base a table stained
for good forgetting all left unaware
In darkened meadows lost
where daisies dance sometimes
Grey clouds will condescend surround
my head a lonely mountain peak
that stands
And waits on light the missing face in crowds
I buzz a bee
to fly a springtime breeze
To gather treasure from my chosen flowers
to drift from daises golden daffodils
And add my honey to the hive the stores
I flew through a window to daisies spied
But when I saw the vase in fear I sighed

* * *















Cryptic conversation bound
and tattoo on the page
Instained within an instant
the moment we oblige

* * *




























Blue mountains loom faded old ghostly glaciers
pale sentinels guard us in the valley
seen now by barren trees empty of leaves
limbs revealed in the fall a final
light from that sunken sun coats
The jagged ridge with shades of frosted fire

This forest still is chilling frozen in time
or waiting for what?
a gust of wind to unleash
Last rusted leaves left hanging by a breath
already dead?
now the silence shattered by a song
a song that sparrow stands alone
pouring endless notes into the night

* * *

















This inequality divides
ourself as one from one
to infinitesimal points
from endlessly expanding space
subtracted unity dissolves
to multiply alone

No wonder how the figures sum
our numbers signal loss
for right-left hands enforced to war
They find their end unless

* * *





















Apparitions under the surface of these shades pulled
down to hide
Who invited them to join this parade? Drift away!

An eagle sleeping on a bed of plucked feathers
dreaming of flight

We knew we never should have gone
We heard the cave was deep

Who wove for me this quilt of worms?
So soft so warm I may find my home

Silence drips from smoke-painted walls until
A bird burst of song illuminates!

I grab a flying note with dying ears
how long will undead seeds sleep in a grave?

* * *














Their faces echo loud to show
sold doctors of our time
To sell prescribe a remedy
as poisonous to some
of deafness dim the veiled voice
But told to hold the weight
by cataracts of consciousness
They contradict the light

* * *
























We could build one kind of death
We could split the sleepers from the sleep
igniting in the past-time fumes awake
Or fuse in slime of swamplands as we creep

* * *




























To this day still
Haunted by the echo of
your smile
I conjure the pain
in such cruel joy

* * *



























Trees under the cold weight
bend
almost break
cling to limbs by frigid fingers
of piled flakes
kept alive by their neighbors left alone
each flake will lose itself in liquid no longer
unique in intricate symmetric shapes
they turn into amorphous drops and merge

Who am I when I
separate my self
hold it over a void
by invisible threads bound
by a web I spin to hold
it here for now
while I wait?

Those melted drops fall to feed
the ground pulled deep down
soaked up by buried seeds
for the birth of a livelier season

* * *










To hear of that cold bitterness
untasted still by me
stirs up unwelcome curious
and dreadful thought a tree
deserves a sudden lightning strike
To wake it when it sleeps
all day within the mist
and dreams to lose a limb
in fatal pleasures madness creeps
in lamps to watch them dim

* * *






















He sleeps in peace not knowing
a snake with cruel intent
Slithers through his sheets
moving
Slowly
towards
his
prey

He sleeps in peace not knowing
a snake is curling tight
while wrapped around his neck
and choking
his
last
breath
he sleeps in peace and death

* * *















Another severed branch
Is rivered out to sea
to meet with every wayward limb
To realive the tree

* * *




























Still to this day I
know of no reason
why I remember
the taste of that toy
or action-figure
To be precise with
suction cups to stick
to glass suspending
this fish-frog-man on
the sliding glass door
of our apartment
where we lived before
they split
before
the territory
of our lives severed
a wall erected
to divorce us from
ourselves I was too
young to remember
us all together
in one place as if
seven years vanished
from my memory
to protect me? sure but
no matter how hard I try
no matter how hard I will
my mind to unlock those times
I fail to retrieve
anything except
the vivid and unwanted
taste of that dumb toy

* * *
I wandered absent through some
desert night that sparkled dome
above was clear as day
the sand was warm beneath my feet
my feet that stumbled hard
on ancient stone protruding
Hidden slyly by the sand
in the hourglass of memory
until my fateful step unveiled
a long forgotten tomb

* * *






















A sudden wind just broke
me loose from the illusion
of firm ground and shelter
that tree just let me
ride the wind abandoned fall
emptied only months ago
in summer
Boxes are filled again
in cardboard walls my life
An autumn breeze cold-shakes the barren trees
and stirs up every fallen leaf
Doors seen from a distance
seem open unlocked dreams
appear in grasp when I reach
out my hands to seize them
such vision slow-dissolves as vapor
Will vanish in a breeze
these things
placed neatly in box after box
artefacts for an afterlife
entombed I
discover a bundle of old
forgotten photos
on this ground of mine
The leaves begin
to stir
that sweater
she knit that sweater
for me I remember
her sitting rocking
on her sun-cracked yellow rocking
chair knitting as I played with toy cars
she let me sit on her lap
Her arms around me
my head on her shoulder resting
(I can still smell her sweet hair)
As she knit me
that sweater
she knew our summer would end
soon
she knew I would need to keep warm
to face the beating winds but
who knew to take that photo
at that very moment as she
First slid my arms through the sleeves
of that soft sweater?
did he envision me decades later
unearthing it from a box bundled
To comfort me?

* * *

















But if we stop now
If we fail her now
you know
what she
will do where
she will go
we just can't
let that
happen can we?

No
we can't

* * *




















Her favorite shoes
black no heels dust
thick over their skin
Buried in a dark closet

* * *




























Or would you fear the worse
if looking back
the retrospect
Divined a kinder curse?

* * *




























He buzzes buzzes
around my head lands
in striking distance
now my hand upraised
finger on trigger
fixed to deliver
death ready … for what?
what crime committed?
what law was broken?
what right do I have
to execute him
an innocent one
just an endlessly
annoying buzzing
fly?
I melt to a pool
a mirror and catch
a glimpse a momentary
glimpse that smacks my pride
such an ugly show
what shame to see in me
the root of war

* * *










Will winter ever show his face?
We hear his footsteps thunder down
Just over distant hills I fear
That nothing could hold back this race
Until the snow fall-floods the ground

* * *



























A dozen doves dash fast in their daring
flights through forests
with thick and fresh foliage
traveling to towns and cities tracing
Circles across the sky quickly encasing
the land enslaving all seven seas
while loudly lauding a lake of love below
barely visible by bravest beings
By violet virgins since vice bestows
a brand of foul
beast-born baggage
but faithful fowls are free of foes
and free of fragile will a foe of freedom
walled with no windows doors or wishes
A dam to water deep dark within dreams
waits to wed with a white-dressed widow

* * *
















The pale blue sky held open wide
and empty
fills up with warmed waves leaving
pathways clear
for radiance traveling until
Heavy clouds form dark to block
That caravan of endless light but still
The stubborn sky
remains through everything
the same

* * *






















Playing in the dismal fire
Trading faces one by one
all will fade all will expire
when the sacred dance is done

* * *




























Descend with me come down below the night
is never ending here beware your step
or fall deep in a dark pit hesitate
a moment bind a chain around your neck
or choke your ears this orchestra to grief
conducted by their want in every voice
there cracks those hissing cries of sold relief
To whom? and why must there be such a noise
to pound our fragile ears? look up above
Those ragged cliffs beyond the looming clouds
that seem to keep us here look up those rays
are guardians against despair they blaze
In everlasting glory but the crowd
will tear the ivory feathers off a dove

* * *


















Along an ashen fused tomb
blueorlludred drup painted backdrop of a dream
slack drolliping beam of ooze
in pools of slooming drips
sliding smooth past trees
blooming barren birdsong silent tapsong
and lost among old dallopsing willows sweet watered down whispering
across a long passage of
songs sung by wallen swans swallowing
the last darkness lost in the hollowing fall

* * *





















We from the garden come
fragranted upon the wind a leaf
falls swift to leave for all
Behind the curtain cursed
are we of death
Have you not seen them steal
to father indistorted dreams
Now sold for our disease?

* * *
























U-nited We
Fall into manu-fractured
S-tates
of mind-care-less
consumption we love this
Sweet land of liberty
for sale the stars
and stripes still wet
stained whose blood?
Let freedom wrong the rights the bill
the coined slogan
of the elect the chosen feud
Let freedom sting with venomous words of serpents
with forked tongues dividing a
more perfect union
Let freedom wrinkle away the skin
this myth lies in a coffin still
many swear by an apparition
denial being a common hope

whose blood is flowing fueling feeding
a cold lead tower rises from
a crimson lake burning
leading the way up
reaching up and growing never
reaching the pure sky grounded
below (firmly
below) lightning will
Let freedom ring
never strike
This tower this land of the free
Of Thee I sing

* * *
And all their courage
(With them)
Turned to dust

* * *





























Down!
Down!
The great walls of the mightiest city will
crumble
and
fall
Down!
At last with wand too weak
his word can cast no spell
Delivered from the peak
that rises up from hell
We dance around the fire turning
who will stop it all from burning?

Look! The ragged temptress
Riding on a serpent
Struck dumb in her madness
Dying with her power spent
She soars above us laughing in her fall
Who here will listen to her shrieking call?

Kings of the earth
Merchants of worth
don't weep over the city that
falls
Down!
Down!
The towering pillars of the mightiest men
will crumble and
fall

Down!

* * *
Behind the powered ash
of drifting clouds reveal
a sliver blue that bashful sky
A glimpse for us to steal

If but a gust of wind
could pierce the fragile skin
would interrupted unity
conceal it within

* * *























By fountain visibly weighed
of traces still remaining fade
to abdicate the day
until the rock is rolled to show
That emptiness if feathers grow
for wings to fly away

* * *


























That light arrives again
to resurrect the morn
Or drop the shade down to the end
a grave to be reborn

How many of us dead
as now and on that day
Will sleep beyond the trumpet call
dissolving life to be?

Or will that thundered blast
pry open every eye
Refusing rest at last to wake
to immortality?

* * *


















Eliminate the wasted time
to tumbled leaves break down
revolving past the daffodil
Infused within of ground

each petal lifts above escape
Perfume the wind to climb
for warmer days to melt away
the ice inside sublime!

* * *























Take these wings
now rise!
Lift swiftly into flight
High up above all stars expand
Your light across celestial seas
of everlasting …

What light unhides our now
just past the horizon?
* * *
























Watch with us this day for the rising sun
the light will melt all memories away
Our long and painful night is almost done

Just listen to the song the birds have spun
they sing in praise to consecrate the day
watch with us this day
for the rising sun

The time is near to
here when shadows run
when all our darkness will
no longer stay
our long and painful night
is almost done

Be glad with us our battle has been won
the victory will soon be on display
watch with us
this day
for the rising sun

Rejoice!

the second coming of
the Sun will set us free
so let us watch and pray
watch with us this day
for the rising sun
Our long and painful night is almost done

* * *


Branches in the wind
Fluttering leaves alive
this music sweeps into
Us paralyzing us
incommon senses we are danced
puppet strings pulling spins
This madness spins around
us hypnotizing us
leaves and limbs alike
here in ecstasy bewildered
we dance!

The Ballad of Thomas King


Some say that many years ago
A man named Thomas King
Roamed wide around the countryside
And everywhere he'd bring

A serpent coiled around his neck
A serpent who would find
Some work for Thomas with its skin
Which saw though it was blind

For meals poor Thomas sang and danced
On stage or anywhere
And since the serpent showed the way
The serpent took its share

For years as Thomas sang and danced
His name became well-known
Until the serpent felt the fame
Instead should be its own

The more poor Thomas sang and danced
The more the serpent stole
And left poor Thomas less and less
For food to fill his bowl

As it grew stronger Thomas King
Fell weaker by the day
As it grew larger Thomas felt
His life fading away


One day poor Thomas could not stand
The sly old serpent weighed
Too much for him to carry while
His light began to fade

"He's losing all his strength at last
For us to keep the show
I'll threw this Thomas on my back
And use my skin to know

Which way to go to find some work
And now that I've grown strong
I'll quickly move this Thomas King
To dance or sing a song"

For years poor Thomas was asleep
All day and night he dreamed
While those who watched him didn't know
All wasn't what it seemed

And life went on and on this way
Until they slithered past
A sage who saw the serpent's tricks
And started then to fast

For seven days and seven nights
The sage refused to eat
He meditated without end
Then rose up to his feet

At once the sage found Thomas King
And praised his spreading fame
He asked poor Thomas, "Would you dance
And live up to your name?"
The serpent answered filled with pride
"I'll dance to any song
Just pay the price and play the tune
And I'll dance right along"

The sage sat down and grabbed his harp
And sang his melody
The serpent lifted Thomas up
To dance for all to see

"Let these words move you to dance
Follow slowly fall in deep
Slip old serpent into trance
Sleep sleep old serpent sleep

Let my voice guide you along
Follow slowly fall in deep
Dream old serpent to this song
Sleep sleep old serpent sleep

Let this rhythm move you slow
Follow slowly fall in deep
Drop old serpent let him go
Sleep sleep old serpent sleep"

And with those words the serpent dropped
And fell into a daze
And yet the sage did not stop then
His voice began to raise

"Wake up Thomas wake up now
That serpent is out cold
Stand up Thomas stand up now
Your life is yours to mold
Wake up Thomas wake up now
That serpent is too weak
Stand up Thomas stand up now
And find the life you seek

Wake up Thomas wake up now
Your moment has arrived
Stand up Thomas stand up now
Thank God you have survived!"

By those good words poor Thomas stood
Now full of life again
The sage said "You must move on now
And let your life begin

I'll hold the serpent in this spell
But go now far away
The serpent will be full of rage
When it wakes with the day"

But Thomas had a different plan
The serpent had to die
To crush the serpent once for all
He held a stone up high

Then Thomas King did as he planned
And smashed the serpent dead
A rush of such ecstatic joy
Filled Thomas toe to head

The sage who saw good Thomas healed
Was happy and relieved
A smile began to lift his cheeks
He saw a life retrieved
Good Thomas warmly thanked the sage
For bringing him to peace
For helping his sweet life return
And happiness increase

But just before they parted ways
The sage removed his knife
And skinned the serpent head to tail
And said "Now start your life

Just wear this skin around your neck
And all the serpent's power
Will be with you each day and night
Like beauty in a flower"

And with those words they parted ways
Never to meet again
Good Thomas roamed the countryside
And wore the serpent's skin

Around his neck as his great fame
Spread far beyond his land
And so he gladly sang and danced
Far longer than he'd planned

And though he lived so long ago
If he had lived at all
Some say they see good Thomas roam
Still happy strong and tall

And if you play a tune for him
He'll dance at your employ
All restlessness will wash away
And leave you filled with joy!








Go
be a black widow
But wed again
and lay a thousand eggs
and watch your darling buds
grow from cracked bone shells
creep in crags
crawl
And dangle in webs

Appendix: Imitations
































Ariel

Stasis in darkness.
Then the substanceless blue
Pour of tor and distances.

God's lioness,
How one we grow,
Pivot of heels and knees!— The furrow

Splits and passes, sister to
The brown arc
Of the neck I cannot catch,

Nigger-eye
Berries cast dark
Hooks —

Black sweet blood mouthfuls,
Shadows.
Something else

Hauls me through air —
Thighs, hair;
Flakes from my heels.

White
Godiva, I unpeel —
Dead hands, dead stringencies.

And now I
Foam to wheat, a glitter of seas.
The child's cry

Melts in the wall.
And I
Am the arrow,

The dew that flies
Suicidal, at one with the drive
Into the red

Eye, the cauldron of morning.

* * *

(Sylvia Plath, 1961)





















Burial

Weightless in silence.
Then the fathomless rose
Flood of edge and precipice.

God's albatross,
How one we raise,
Bend of wing and feathers!— The swift blaze

Sparks and flashes, father to
The white fold
Of the back I cannot clutch,

Raven-eye
Berries drop cold
Blades —

Dark sweet juice scalpels,
Specters.
Something else

Pulls me with wind —
Hair, skin;
Frost from my palms.

Pale
Medusa, I embalm —
Live heads, live ecstasies.

And now I
Ooze to wine, a glimmer of tides.
The sun's light

Burns in the stone.
And I
Am the night fog

The mist the spreads
Suicidal, at one with the rise
Into the blue

Sky, the gravestone of evening.

The Fish

wade
through black jade.
Of the crow-blue mussel-shells, one keeps
adjusting the ash-heaps;
opening and shutting itself like

an
injured fan.
The barnacles which encrust the side
of the wave, cannot hide
there for the submerged shafts of the

sun,
split like spun
glass, move themselves with spotlight swiftness
into the crevices —
in and out, illuminating

the
turquoise sea
of bodies.  The water drives a wedge
of iron through the iron edge
of the cliff; whereupon the stars,

pink
rice-grains, ink -
bespattered jelly-fish, crabs like green
lilies, and submarine
toadstools, slide each on the other.



All
external
marks of abuse are present on this
defiant edifice —
all the physical features of

ac -
cident — lack
of cornice, dynamite grooves, burns, and
hatchet strokes, these things stand
out on it; the chasm-side is

dead.
Repeated
evidence has proved that it can live
on what can not revive
its youth.  The sea grows old in it.

* * *
(Marianne Moore, 1935)














The Cats

reach
through shade peach.
Of the dove-grey salmon-bones, one stops
removing the scale-tops;
opening and shutting its eyes like

a
cloudy day.
The sewer rats which infest the deep
of the street, cannot sleep
there for the lamp-shone beams of a

car,
shine like star -
light, roll themselves with foghorn slowness
into their fortresses —
left and right, illuminating

the
grey city
of pipe-dreams.  The smoke-fumes paint a coat
of shadows where the shadows float
on the wall; where the neon signs

pink
glow-worms, stink -
enveloped alley-rats, bums like brown
anthills, and deep downtown
sewers, sleep each on the other.



All
unnatural
scars of progress are fused onto this
dishonored edifice —
all the spiritual symptoms of

fall -
en-ness — sprawl
of slave-poor, murderous eyes, drugs, and
billboard lies, these expand
out in it; the alley-way is

dead.
Refuted
evidence has shown that we can grow
when high subjects the low
to life.  The light grows dim in us.
