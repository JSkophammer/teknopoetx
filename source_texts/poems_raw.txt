Collected PoemsFalling in fluid dream spells        liquid visions bending real and unreal:Flames rain down        billowed doomsday volcanoesRaining sparks             lighting cigarettes in crowded streetsSnowing solemn ashes                hiding sidewalk ant colonyBraving unforeseen storm for final sugar from Unfinished melting monument left                                                         sacrificed at feet of steel mountainsStretching tall fingertips toward the sky and clouds and sunShining alone in darkness filling cold vacancy with breathing beams of lifeBursting ecstatic pouring forth all light and heat and self,Grasping planets with long arms while they rollAround and around Forever drifting around,Free and unbound Slowly drifting around,Silent—no sound Always drifting aroundAround, around, aroundPaper waste balls scattered spinning in empty streets dancing,Raining gently wind whispering song sweetly, Speaking softly, our sun implores some clouds to spreadSo he may shower us with his bright glance—Looking at the sun peak through the clouds my heart ignitesAnd I smile,Forgiving those clouds for snow and raindrops loosed upon this rainbow sky.*   *   *Tattered flags blaze on oil-soaked soilSchools and homes are returned to dust by Smart bombs, Smart pilots, Smart officers in command,As money grows from smart investments in war.Digital souls are created,Patterns of information in form of I AM,Neural networks model wakened minds,Quantified modes of cognition,Artificially intelligent friends and familyAnd slaves for exploitation.At last, we are gods!“Children are carefully designed in clean labs to beSubmissive, passive, obedient to all commands,Intelligent, loyal, free from illness:We can make him athletic, musical, mathematical, generous, charismatic, despising all criminals,Using only computers to manipulate biological data,Safely creating the children of your choice...For the right price, of course.”*   *   *IOn a lighter note—Musical poetry of Bach weaves sonic threadsInto forms of incarnate beauty.Violins sing polyphonic hymns—Blending questions and answers with delicacy,Holding tension fixed strong tight before Releasing and relaxing into gentle freedom.All graceful patterns born from his heart—His womb of perfection.The strings of my soul respond,We sing together,We sing, rising together,Rising together faster, rising Higher and higher until my stretching soul explodes, releasingFloods of peace, dissolvingTime and space And me.*   *   *IIMusic of poetry,Poetry of music,Speak one and speak bothForms of beauty,Beauty of forms.*   *   *IIIInnumerable angels swoop in graceful Serene patterns—a tapestry in counterpoint—Interwoven threads of crystal beauty—A radiant, ethereal realm Of mystic beaming spaceBreathing, loving, lifting you highIn boundless heaven, Blissful!*   *   *Opposing forces battle:Blind eternal attractionCreates our grey world between shadow and light—Positive to negative Woman to manYin to yangDay to nightZero to infinityAnd so onAll and Nothing entwine into Something:Electromagnetic forces unite our universe in energetic webs,Dancing matter and antimatter—What is born from their deadly bond?What form is infused in their fatal union?Form caught in metaphors,Soul of symbols,Heart of images,Omnipresent abstract pattern—Hold this, Drop that,Fix firmly to form idea,Store in Museum of Mental ArtifactsOr use as a tool,But leave it etched on lens for future views.Before or after, blindness or sight,Mountains or valleys, darkness or light,Crooked or straight, wrong or right,Sun emits and moon reflects,Inside life or outside death.And as hate dividesSo does love unite.*   *   *In the beginning,The word once resounded,And echoed through darkness extension unbounded.Waves spun webs of cosmic pictures Painted and formed,Changing as time pursued and pursues her circuitous journeyTo an eternal horizon beyond east and west and north and south—A timeless realm of oblivion.Abysmal mad funeral march of timeA fuse burning past to future present,Leaving ashes,Last remnant of historical events,Frozen and lost beyond mortal hands,Final fragments of memory,Only surviving proof of traveled roads—Words spoken And actions written In cosmic records With golden ink.*   *   *I celebrate the mind!That electric stimulus-response system in the hardware of the brain,Swimming in amorphous oceans,Violet waves of magnetic mist vibrations,Telepathic interconnected network of organic unified consciousness,Receiving messages and transmitting messages through all perceived boundaries of matter. Electric sphere of awareness radiatingThoughts linked to thoughts in chains,Ideas, intuitions, intentions,Channels of consciousness halting and flowing, Endlessly chasing and guiding our views,Grasping and losing—Forgetting the point.Angels and devils Perched on my shouldersSway my intentions And shed light on paths,Left to right or right to left My will oscillates,Fluctuating weak and confused,I bend to pleasures Ignoring better guides.O Mind, who would I be without your glowing embrace?Biological computer hardware with No software,No program language,No possibility of thought.I don’t think;Therefore,I am not.*   *   *Advancements of technology,Scientific pride of civilization:Fast-forward movement through commercials,Download new ideas and perspectives,“I’ll have a double Grande mocha Frappuccino topped with the Internet please.I do love my 1.21 billion gigabyte blu-ray mp3 nanocomputer phone and camera,But when will the latest be released?*   *   *Shhh! A death looms near us,A loosened soul is leaving,Heading home,Holding One Last Breath in lungs—Now exhale, release…You’re free*   *   *Word collage meaning fragmentsCombine contrast show glimpsesImages evokedWord soulsSemantic beauty seeds.*   *   *Images, colors, letters,Words of myriad characters—Elements of creation.Imagination—Emperor of the faculty of innovation,Magician of many wonders—Speaking forms into view from behind a curtain:Elements arrange and unite for inspection,Some stay in sight,Some vanish,None stay past their welcome.*   *   *Foolish shadows flicker outWith fickle hidden source.Thoughts are lost and pass in darkness,Beliefs once held dear, are Sacrificed without care,Abandoned,Lost without a trace or sign,Though impressions endure—Ghosts of memory.*   *   *A church bell tolls…No sun will rise.A church bell tolls…Stop!Just let me suffer.An infant cries…No rest will soothe her.An infant cries…Stop!Her mother found her.A sun is rising…The night is passing.A sun is rising…Your warmth is soothing.A river flows…No need to stop it.A river flows…Whispering softly.Air perfumed by roses,Incense burned for gods,No church bell tolls,While on this grass I lay,No infant cries, No heart safe to stay,A sun still rises, Cloudy breath caressing face,A river still flows, Her song is lulling me away.I live and breathe this jasmine air,With weighted lids let go for sleep.Silence trembles stirring fear,Winds are howling creeping near,Clutching hard for life held dear…I let go now,Releasing all my cherished fears.*   *   *Liquid bliss—invisibleRadiant elixir of crystal waterPure heavenly streamsDrops of merciful blessings raining on living fieldsAngels and spirits and all with open armsSinging praises, prayers and hymnsRaising voices with winged in musicAll beings feeling breathingHoly air Holy light Holy incense burned Smoke elevating to most highSphere of eternal realm inside realm,One within one Moment of timeOne day for the livingOne love for binding soul and soulHeart and heart Connected sharingWarmth and self with all creation.*   *   *Philosophy puzzles Intrigue and confuseSaving minds from hidden dangers.A focused lens,A sharpen sword,A conceptual web illuminated.See through the eyes of forgotten thinkers,See the world through their rose colored lenses,See right or left black or white,Opposing views but neither right,Reflecting on both,Equal points are made,A thirst unquenched,A debt unpaidTo those expectingTo find answers,To solve riddles.Others seek nothing more,No rainbow with gold,Just buildings of sand,No prophecy or truth foretold,Since seeking fuels Those expanding souls.*   *   *Nighttime drive In rain and fear, Quick around a curve And up a hill,

Launching me off the ground—While flying I begin to thinkNow is this time I’ll die—My car crashes into The roof of a house—

           Before my eyes standsAn awesome sight:                                                         Our Lord himself Our Savior wearing his crown Of thorns, as blood Drips down his face.Our eyes connect,I freeze,Struck in awe—Held by the fear of God—I awakePuzzled and shuddering.I wake from a dream:I was sleeping on the couch,In the living room.I decide to take a late Night bathroom trip, so IWalk in the darkTo the dark bathroom.I step inside and turn To face the mirror, thenI flip the light switch—Illumination—I look forward, andWithin the mirror standsAn awful sight,Standing behind my back,The devil himself—A shadow of evil with glowing eyes—Our eyes connect,I froze shocked Locked in horror,I awake,Stunned and trembling.*   *   *I love that sun,And he loves me,We know each other deeply.I look into his eye,And he in mine,Both of us blinded with love,Filling me with tender warmth—I know he feels the same.*   *   *Sparkling pleasant winter frostCoats our ground and trees and home,Saluting Dawn and her rosy fingersIcy in the morning mist,The sun unveils his presence,Lifting nighttime sky,Melting nighttime snow,Beholding the world through his radiant self.*   *   *O gentle leafLeft hanging there, Discarded onHer broken web—Invisible to naked eyes—Swinging on her noose.You have descended From a higher place,With just a thread Of life remaining:Preserved by loveFrom sudden death.Now you hang, aDismembered toyOf tickling wind,Dancing for her Pleasure, through changeFrom night to day.And if by chanceOur Mother severs Your silver cord, thenFall with faith, so Free from care, andKnow this song Will always hold you safely.*   *

next to me, Why would I dare fear?When I feel your breath within my limbs,How could I stop now?*   *   *Dig! Dig! Cut the ground with a shovel!Time will give the house a shape,Just dig!Dig now, dig deep, and dig always,Lay the foundation later,Set the floor first and the walls will find their way.“How many builders should I ask to help?”“How many temples should the walls contain?”“But how should I ensure the rooms are filled?”“And how should I remove this doubt I feel?”They will come from east and west—They will come from near and far—They will come to see wonders and sights—They will come to see visions of peace—They will come to hear worship and praise—They will come to hear people rejoice—They will come to receive and give love!*   *   *When I walk blindly in a pit of snakes,You keep my feet safe.When I am caught uncovered in violent storms,You send a tree for shelter.When I raise my fist and nearly curse you, You put your finger across my lips and smile.I have been wandering for so long, so long,Defiling your temple with filth—Will it ever end?I even try to bury myself alive,But your earthquake always splits the grave,And coughs me up,Just letting me practice for later.*   *   *In your arms I amAn infant held safe—Your body warms me,Your breath washes across me,Your love shines bright within me,Your fire rushes through me,Burning the dead trees,Scattering the dark clouds,Lifting me out of myself.*   *   *Leaves lift and dance above the graves—All trees disrobed—their lives exposed—Our leaves are always shed before your eyes—Nothing can hide from your gaze.You know our birth and death,Our roots are deep within your ground, We drink the water of your spirit,And feed on the land of your body.What waits for us in the future?Earth full of flowers and fruit,As all returns from winter’s death.*   *   *Wait all night in dark rooms,Grow suspicious with time,Lift stones and tear down wallsFor evidence of broken vows.Catch words like strange fish,Examine its slippery ways,Spend your life afraidYour love is not shared.None of this for me!My love lights each room,Never leaving my side.My love is always true, And truth allows no lies.The words from my love are alive!Your words rise the sun,And the flowers and birds,Your words move the windThat caresses my worn heart.I offer handfuls of sand, butMy love gives me more than every beach,As I float—Immersed in the ocean of bliss.*   *   *It was a strange day When I opened my eyes For the first time.I looked in the mirror And saw myself For the first time.Every mark and blemish Were suddenly visible,In light not blinding, butFull of revealing power.It was a strange day When you opened my eyes For the first timeAnd showed me your beautiful face.*   *   *This game we play of hide-and-seek Is strange—You hide and hide,And when I look,I find you everywhere.Always disguised,Never unveiled,Plainly shrouded in mystery.Flame of flames,Wind of winds,Sea of seas,Stone of stones,Where are you not found?In you we live And move and have Our being—We love and breathe And sleep within Your voice.Cups of shadows holdThe radiant water—All from one spring,While emptiness divides.We see an endless ocean,And long to sail home,And wait for the day,When all shadows will dissolve,And the water will spill from our cups,Uniting us with you again.*   *   *How do I so easily forget?I’ll dash and dance in pouring rain,Whirling and laughing and singing,And yet,By the time I walk inside my home,I’ve forgotten my clothes are all wet.Please, do not let me forget to listenAs you whisper gentle music in my ears.Please, do not let me forget to lookAs you unveil your beauty before my eyes.Why do I close my eyes so quickly and shut out all your light?You’ll wake me up and lift me to heaven to behold your majestic glory!Nothing else matters to me in that moment!Nothing compares to the beauty of that moment!Nothing!And yet,I’ll soon weigh myself downAnd descend in the darkAs I quickly forgetAnd fall back asleep.*   *   *Who will protect us From the blood-thirsty wind?Who will shield us From the murderous sun?When the floods stalk us through streets and the ground swallows our feet,Who will keep us safe?They set snares and netsThey cast bolts from golden mountainsThey peer into our private thoughtsThey torture any threats They kill the truth with poison wordsThey silence those with antidotesThey lock the free in chainsThey turn this land into a prisonWho will protect us now?*   *   *Your lightning glance Explodes my heart Tears bathe my face      Breath held in aweLocked hypnotized in blissful trance—None could resist your magnetic drawUnless they fly above the highest law*   *   *To create beauty is sacredArtists follow the path of PrometheusLighting the world with heavenly fireChains fail to bind spirits—the DivineFinds a home in beauty*   *   *How could I thank youFor love and life and all else:A blazing kiss from the morning sun on my skin,A gentle caress from the wind, Firm ground to dance and play upon,To stop me from falling when I get carried away?I could go onBut your blessings are endless—My ink would run dry, soI’ll just have to show you,And finish this poem,With the rest of my life.*   *   *My beloved was busyIn the beginningOf time, buildingThis house—Lining the wallsWith wallpaperOf sparkling galaxiesAnd weaving tapestriesWith long threadsOf universal force.He is soothing and gentle,Holding me now with loveIn His warm embrace—Only a child in the arms of a mother,Knows such safety and peace.*   *   *Looking and looking but never finding,I don’t remember forgetting my…Listening closely but never hearing,I don’t remember forgetting my…My hands and feet and beating heart,And eyes deep cratered in my skull,My marrowed frame and fleshly clothes,All laughed when I forgot To remember my Self.*   *   *AtlantisAtlantis, Atlantis,At last will you enchant us?Tell us of your crystal cavesBuried in the seaTell us of the healing lightBleeding from our sunTell us how to harness forceFlowing endlesslyTell us how to bring destructionAnd how to sink as well.Atlantis, Atlantis,At last will you enchant us?*   *   *Unzip the skin of stones and treesPeek into the hidden life of windIs there some mystery to find?Is there some answer for the seas?Wearing a mask, a mask, another maskHiding in many costumes of our fabricEvery dancing leaf,Every daffodil,Every drop of rain,Every daring breathAre drops of bloodFrom a fatal woundIn a joyous actOf self-sacrifice, soWhere will you be whenAll is resurrected? *   *   *I am a cat,My master is invisible,I never know when he’s comingTo rub my back And make mePurr.*   *   *Who can see me now?These words that are meGush forth in ecstatic profusion Like a bull wild and angry Held in his cage until the moment The gate opens and he bucks violently in a shocking display of force.Who can see me?My life expressedBy marks on paperAnd sounds that echoIn the silence of souls.*   *   *All praise to the glory of God!He wipes the tears of us afflicted,And warms us freezing in the cold,Though with our sins conflicted,We are safe in His mighty stronghold,Beaming with love and boldAs our Savior resurrected.All praise to the glory of God!*   *   *Lord I beg youShine your lightAnd keep my feet from stumblingPlease light my pathWith endless loveAnd end this rebel’s grumbling*   *   *In the fieldWith hand on plowI praise the almighty GodThis plow I wieldTo work the landWas made by the hand of GodThese seeds I plantThis womb of soilThis air I breatheMy faithful heart And that sun still sheddingLife to us allWere made by the loving hand of God*   *   *Prepare your heartsTo hear from the Word of GodThe holy words of the almighty God Creator of the vast universeRuler of all heaven and earthPrepare your heartsFor the coming of the WordAs lightning from the heavens above!*   *   *Dogwood limbsHold above my headDove flowers with curvedPetals like wingsOf angels In flight.Willows droop longIn the dark mirrored pondWith echoes of swans Splashing asideThe water as they move their wings to glide.*   *   *You offer a banquet, But I eat from trash.Why do I still turn my eyes from You?You, who are my love,You, who are my breath,Why do I turn my eyes so quickly?I cut my hand,And You heal the wound within,So I grab a knifeAnd cut again.I jump in the waterHeavy boulder in handAnd wonder whyI keep falling ForGravity’s demand.*   *   *To You my God today I singWith all the praises I can bringNo words can hold Your boundless love,Or prove Your glistening realm above!Give me no sign nor vision nowBut only to Your love allowMy tired self to lay and restOn sacred land that You have blessed!*   *   *At tipsy times when glasses call for wineThank God that careful hands once pruned the vine.*   *   *Let us dance across those golden hillsAcross those stretching hills of emerald hueLet us dance!Come with me!  Come with me!  Now do you see them?!  Do you see the heavenly fields the sun is blessing for you and for me?Do you see them?Come with me now and we’ll stretch in the fieldsWe’ll stretch forever in the flowers—come with me!We’ll dance in the eternal fields of our soulAs we are but one soul embracing all fields and all suns!Come with me now and you will see them all!*   *   *Slowly, slowly, I move forward each day, One step each day, Slowly.The days are full of lessonsAnd the nights as wellAre full of lessons to all students of our world,As days and nights are full.My blood spills into inkStaining pages—With the life of my wordsI offer sacrifice.But will this sacrifice bring life?And these words,Will these words bring any life?For meThey’ve beenMy death, my lifeThey’ve served their purpose well.*   *   *       Go Be a black widowBut wed againAnd lay a thousand eggs, And watch your darling buds   Grow from cracked bone shells,   Creep in crags,   Crawl, And dangle in webs.*   *   *      I plucked flowers	  Forgetting time         In rolling fields	  With clouds on headThose hidden powers	  Freed up this rhyme   That my Self yields	  And leaves me dead.*   *   *My eyelids open slowlyAs sleep still casts its spell,But ears wake quickly to the sweet,Soft and winged and powerfulSound of her loving voice,Caressing morning air,Filling it with healing lightFor wounds suffered last night.Curtains crack a creviceDawn’s fingers stretch a wave—A slab of sun in caverned roomSmall specks of dust reveal:Illuminated just one momentBefore passing into Empty darkness once againTo twirl and fly within.*   *   *He sleeps in peace without knowingA snake with cruel intentSlithers through his sheetsMovingSlowlyTowardsHisPrey.He sleeps in peace without knowingA snake is curling tightWhile wrapped around his neckAnd choking His Last Breath—He sleeps in peace and death.*   *   *I’ll never forget the nightWhen I forgot my nameI remember itLike yesterdayOr today.White walls stretched to infinity and back againWhen I released my thoughts, I began To slip awayTo lose control, I began To fear where I was goingSo I counted slowlyOne, two, three…Trying to hold onto something fixedSomething knownBut I kept slipping, soI just let goThen everything went darkFor a time and half a timeUntil I emergedAs if just bornOn a foreign planetWithout memoryAware only of awarenessUnspoiled by thoughtsUntil I sawMy hands and thoughtThese here are my handsMy human hands And I see them through my eyesMy human eyes—Of course!I’m a human beingOn Earth In CaliforniaIn an apartment On a couch—Of course!The framework reassembled itselfIn front of my eyes(My human eyes)But a question was hanging like a cloud—A confusing questionAn absorbing question:What was I forgetting?I didn’t know and hence my confusionHence my confusionUntil that momentWhen lightning struck:I remembered IHad forgotten my name.*   *   *Watch the rocking and swaying of waves on the seaAnd the crew below motionless resting in sleep—All those quiet old sailors without room for rum—While their skeletons rest in a silence so deep.*   *   *The drowsy air holds dawn in faded lightAs sparrows raise their song to wake the world,Unfurling flowers drown the fields with life—A garden grown and nurtured right by GodLong refreshed by rivers of His loveFlowing freely deep inside each soul.A man awakes—his mind, body, and soulStill live in harmony; his steps are light,His heart is soft and swiftly moved by love,He loves each breath he takes within the world,He prays aloud and sings his praise to God,And thanks Him for His light and love and life.He works all day and night to fill his life,His food is bread for body, but his soulStill lives only on living words of God,And starves when lingering clouds obstruct the light—Darkness eclipsing both his mind and worldThat blocks the flowing channels of his love.His fear obscures each soothing ray of loveThe sparrow sings a muted song; all lifeSeems separated by a gulf; his worldWas caving in around his captured soulLost stumbling in the shadows, barred from lightAnd blind to all the healing balm of God.But then he heard the vibrant voice of GodAnd followed Him in faith.  Unbounded loveWas waiting to consume him, then God’s lightFlashed at once and filled his eyes with lifeAs waters gushed forth from his loving soulAnd poured to all the creatures in the world.He dances to the music of the worldHis heart spins to the holy wind of GodAs fields of flowers bloom inside his soul;His breath expands and fills the sky; his loveEmbraces all, infusing all; his lifeBursts like the sun to spread its blessed light.Just look!  God shines in every living SoulHe sent His Son (for He Loves all the World!)To be the Light and the eternal Life.*   *   *II dip my cup so deep in streamTo fill it faithful—full—From some old water source unseenWhose spring is always still.A pregnant mother giving birthTo children in the starsWithin the quiet universe:A vision—Flash!—appears.*   *   *IITo golden hills—afar—We walk unseen—Memory—a better frame—Embraces home—Fields laced with lilies—glazed—Feed off the sun.*   *   *IIIA lotus flower—bright—unfoldsA thousand petals—arms—Stretched and stretched—to grab the sun—The source—with hopeless limbsLeft floating—utterly relaxed—The fish patrol the deep—By sworn oaths—solemn—they protectThe lotus—to the drop.*   *   *	IVA poppy seed—invisible—Begins to shine—a light—Held fused inside a gentle bliss—We eagerly await.A wind is stirred—mysterious—A breath—incalculable—Each sacred life is spoken—once—In joyful syllables!*   *   *	VA Butterfly on my tongue BornHas flown away—from Me—Without a Farewell glance—He left—To join his FamilyAs soft Notes fly—a lonely Flute—Afraid of following—Remains in Silence—Absolute—Unfathomable Dream.*   *   *I wandered slowly through someDesert night—that sparkled dome Above was clear as day—The sand was warm beneath my feet—My feet that stumbled hardOn ancient stone protruding—Hidden slyly by the sandIn the hourglass of memoryUntil my fateful step unveiledA long forgotten tomb.*   *   *A dove ascendsChain in his beakBroke mid-air fallingI’m free!*   *   *If my words Could stir a wind And separate the cloudsA second would Be enough time To see the splendid rays And give purpose to my days.*   *   *The cross that is my sword and is my shield, Will crush him down until his armies yield.*   *   *I look into her eyes—Her arrows fly,And strike my heart,And disassemble me.*   *   *IPiled down nowhere within   the goldWaits warm under soft soil covers   lostAlone I know the value   Have I passedMy final chance to have?

With water gone, a signAppears as shriveled grape-skins fingers clutch.That this is death is clear for all to seeThe body useless with the spirit goneAs gloves that sit without the hands to beAs moved as light is when she wakes at dawn.Should Art in all its faces suffer this?Should God be banned from Art once and for all?We sacrifice those glimpses of His blissAnd settle for an art that is too small.My God let me not stray from sacred ways,When keeping grapes filled up with joyous praise!*   *   *XLVIIAn elevator becomes a coffinSo claustrophobic and suffocatingThe world’s pillows still couldn’t softenThe fear I feel with you while waitingFor your floor or mine, whichever is first;Moments seem eons, my eyes glued to floor,To glimpse eye to eye, for me is the worstIt is the confrontation I deplore.We stand together, images of God,But you don’t know I love you, nor do youWant me to, but I must, though it seems odd,And so I hide the love I know is true.Although this sure seems plausible to me,I fear it’s me I don’t want you to see.*   *   *XLVIIIYou are my love and God, my heart alwaysIs Yours, though beating other tunes at timesYour voice will call me back into Your dazeForgiving all infractions, heinous crimesWill wash from me, Your touch obliterateSo gently from the love well-spring You areIt seems unjust for loving me whose hateFor Your good will, at times I go too farBut still You love me in my dirty ragsYou promised one day robes washed white with bloodAnd freedom from the heavy burden dragsThat pull my feet back deep into the mud.I love You so much there’re no words to show;I speak as if You don’t already know.*   *   *XLIXOne day I plucked some flowers—pricked by thorns—I bound her lovely bouquet with my bloodAnd pain as well—a pain nobody scorns—That pain for love brought me a joyous flood—It washed the thoughts of all but her away—She stood alone in the desert of my mind—Sun-struck—while I kept begging her to stayShe turned and kicked up dust—left me behindWhich snapped me back to urgent task at hand—How best arrange the flowers I’d just stoleTo satisfy her pickiest demandProviding me with her most sweet console.I plucked those flowers just for her to see—Her heart was locked—I thought I had the key.*   *   *LA man bought bags of questionable seedsFor tenth of price that grew in half of timeInfecting his last garden plot with weedsA fool, maybe, committing yet no crime.Until he twisted—whirlwind in rageAnd spread the destruction across his friend’sFresh ground with poison seeds—a war to wageWith him he battles fierce but never ends.As words in minds will sprout new imagesThe poet’s pen through graceful motion wieldsGreat power with those earthly visagesPlanted with art in all the reader’s fields.A vulture hunts while his unmoving preyStill waits in bliss for his old yesterday.*   *   *LIMy love will stay at home, when I go outPleading me to hold her, one last timeWe love each other dearly, without doubtBut I still leave her daily, slick as slimeAnd wander on my ways, from crooked birthSo drunk with freedom’s wine, drunk with powerI stumble in my drunkenness, and mirthFrom hole to crowded hole, without flower.The stupor always fades, like passing mistAt times when I remember, the face ofMy love that waits for me, her I resistAt home, she wishes my embrace, my love.Waiting for the moment, that’s coming soonWe both are ever-present, to commune.*   *   *LIIThe worms are waiting and I wish them well,To fill their empty plates and silverware.Top graveyard soil where the smart worms dwell,I long to host their most festive affair.To give away much life so free in deathAnd feed a thousand creatures God has made,I’d gladly sacrifice my mortal breathIf God considers debt I owe’s been paid.But if His will is that I live and work,Then I accept such honor gratefullyAnd will resist the tempting call to shirkThe calling given to me graciously.Let us be worms and with each other feastOn rotting flesh of Love—that lovely beast.*   *   *LIIII’ll craft a gothic lemon nectar standTo sell for pennies what I’ve squeezed from daysTo rival castles from Fairytale-landWith twirling rainbow towers to amaze.I’m crafting this stand under night’s coverAt world’s traffic intersection high,High above the lamblike clouds that hover,Enough for me to witness purest sky.Or is my head just floating in a cloud?And what of visions: castles and towers?Are these the thoughts I shouldn’t share aloud?My mind deceived with imagined powers?She says in labor, “Is this how it’s done?Are you sure, Doc, the process has begun?”*   *   *LIVA boulder rests impatient on a hillJust waiting for the wind or hands to tip.An arrow’s straight and armed with archer’s skillBow bending, arrow clenched by vicious grip.A man sits silent in his car.  With his carRunning, carelessly enjoying his song,Ready to travel to horizons farInside a closed garage—won’t take too long.We poison drinking water with unseen,New elements we crafted with our handsI hope that their creators didn’t meanTo enslave earth increasing our demands.If flash of vision showed our looming fate,Would human follies soon ameliorate?*   *   *LVBombarded by memories I almostForgot.  Of times when seeds were first plantedWhen I began stretching for future’s ghostThat promised me all my wishes granted.I dreamed of great things, as I still do now,Sitting on reserves of pure potentialTo be brought to full fruition somehowBy circumstances most providential.It started one day with PythagorasAnd his famous theorem I thought unproved,So I tried to do the world a serviceAnd move a rock lay centuries unmoved.The joy of that discovery still lives,In shame I hope Pythagoras forgives.*   *   *LVII hear the symphony of the cosmosIn silence living deep in slice of time,Or is it a chorus?  Only God knowsPerfection of His music so sublime.It began with a bang, “Let there Be Light!”Energy bursting and opening wide,So wide stretching time, space and all in sight,By universal law was rest implied.Everything unfolds as a cosmic floodOf evolutionary energyThat pours forth as the life of divine bloodThat flows so free from weight or lethargy.A parade walks the streets while waking allThat sleep while bidding them with whispered call.*   *   *LVIIBig Brother watches, laughing at us all,At us, citizens of the United States,He stares in our ears with machines so smallRecording movements as each hair vibrates.“Look—scary monsters, vicious teeth and blood,All signs of danger, citizens alert,You feel a sprinkle, know it’s a floodThat none but God or Us can help subvert.We will protect you, but there is a costWe hate to ask it and sorry we mustYour privacy and freedom will be lostAnd no, there’s nothing left to be discussed.”It’s for our own good Big Brother assures:Bind ‘Him’ in darkness so freedom endures!*   *   *LVIIII love this art, regardless free or boundWith words unlike or words chosen that rhyme,Some speak while slipping patterns into soundWhile others choose the word that’s most sublime.I love the soothing sound of rain on leavesEach drop a life, a note in symphony,But I give room for what the mind perceivesWith thoughts and images in harmony.Some speak to me gently, some with loud voiceSome hide their eyes, others cut their veilsAnd some just play for fun, but that’s their choiceMy art’s from love and all that it entails.As poetry can bind those torn apart,Then let me not profane this sacred art.*   *   *LIXA star in distant galaxy burns bright,It hangs in space with satellites around,The planets held by gravity’s string boundTied tight to source of life—that pregnant light.The star thinks, “Here I am a shining starAs a speck in a galactic systemExploding without having the wisdomTo explain an existence so bizarre.”But his thoughts were halted by the beautyAbove of a rainbow nebula cloudThat he always forgets to look and seeWhen pressing thoughts begin to flood and crowdAnd questions rise as to why our being’s free,The star holds the planets beaming proud.*   *   *LXOn proud display—old daisies rest—the vaseDrops tears of mystery—slow falling fears—A ring of residue—oak table stainedFor good—forgetting all left unaware.In darkened meadows—lost—where daisies dance—Sometimes grey clouds will condescend—surroundMy head—a lonely mountain peak—that standsAnd waits on light—the missing face of crowds.I buzz—a bee—to fly in springtime blissTo gather treasure from my chosen flowers To drift from daises to gold daffodilsAnd add my honey to our hive—the stores.I buzzed through the window to daisies spiedBut when I saw the vase in fear—I sighed.*   *   *LXIA dozen doves dash fast in their daringFlights through forests with thick and fresh foliageTraveling to towns and cities tracingCircles across the sky quickly encasingThe land enslaving all seven seas,While loudly lauding a lake of love below,Barely visible by bravest beingsOr violet virgins, since vice bestowsA brand of foul beast-born baggage—Those faithful fowls are free of foesAnd free of fragile will—a foe of freedom—Walled with no windows, doors or wishes.A dam to water deep dark within dreamsWaits to wed with a white-dressed widow.*   *   *LXIILet’s swim in the lake together, you and I!We must go, we must go now, before the summer setsBefore leaves turn and fall, we must go, you and IWe must swim in the eternal lake of heavenAnd earth, we must go, but only you and ILet no one know, let no one follow, let’s goPast the sunset together, you and IWe must hurry now, for now it’s time to go!You and I? Why am I calling for you and I?We’ve never met, we never will, and stillI insist, and I insist on you and I.But know it doesn’t matter, know that I don’t careKnow that all this talk of you and IIs just talk of two wings of a bird in the air.*   *   *LXIIIAnother sonnet of sonnets is hereMy will to compose is draining, and my strengthIs on the edge of submitting to fear—To sacrifice my dreams of any length.I begin, and begin, once and againWith a torch lighting only a few feetIn the dark cave I’ve been wandering in—Wandering in circles—doomed to repeat.Sometimes I hate, and curse my former wordsThat bind me in contracts my mind abhorsAs it needs the flight and freedom of birdsWith all open windows and smashed down doors.I’ll find a route to write a hundred downAnd on my way some countless fish will drown.*   *   *LXIVUntil these poems flow as smooth as breath,Until my heart will beat verse upon verse,I’ll spill my blood in this ecstatic deathTo break the sway of the amateur curse.Visions of Parnassus move me forward;A promise of a sacred dance with nine,A promise in a song at night I heard,A song that moves with harmony divine.But if this song was played with my own flute,And whispered voices were none but my own,Then sew my lips shut and ensure I’m muteAnd prune those fantasies now overgrown.But if the Muses are calling my name,I would love to play in their sacred game.*   *   *LXVAt times I close my eyes and think of usTogether, old and in our future bed(With wishful thought that time’s been generousLeaving those subtle proofs of time unsaid.)We sit and talk before it’s time to sleepAnd talk of all the years we’ve shared as oneAnd all the years we watched our youth just creep,A youth that faded as the setting sun.I see us looking back on these young daysAnd smiling at our foolish youth in springAnd all the tricks of Cupid’s foolish ways,And all the joy such playfulness did bring.But then my eyes open and I see youAnd all the foolish love we can’t subdue.*   *   *LXVIThe clock breaks my heart with each tick and tockEach grain of sand’s a boulder crashing downWithin this hourglass I cannot breakNo matter what force I may beat and poundI rest from the fight when the fighting’s doneFor now, until my strength returns againWhen all the life I’ve lost will then be foundAs I pull water from the well withinYet I know only death can split the groundOf time open to our mind’s confusionWhere holy hymns are sung without a soundWhere music wakes those in true illusionWhere we become water, only to drownAnd in the depths of You receive the crown.*   *   *LXVIIHow to channel emotions into words—Let me try tonight with this poem hereLet me try tonight to move my mind towardsA state without wild emotion and clear.I raised him from twig to cane under myRight hand to rest upon at times neededBut a knot once small grew large and that’s whyMy trust was lost—I tossed the cane aside.And yet the knot may not have been his fault—A tree unaware of the fruit produced—Actions done blindly—not meant to assaultThe hand it did to cause a lasting wound.He really doesn’t seem to understandYou never, never bite the feeding hand.*   *   *LXVIIIOnly Your cross, only Your cross, onlyYour death can save me from eternal deathFrom my mind’s hell—never mind the master—Untwisting the knots my mind keeps twisting—Only Your suffered cross ends sufferingOnly Your unjust pain heals our just pain—But more than pain and more than sufferingYour cross is a gift—a true gift of love.For years and years the catholic image ruledYour bruised, pierced body and Your crown-pierced headWith Your sunken ribs and Your grief-sunk headI failed to look and failed to seeBelow death’s face there was a face of lightA joy that Your death would bring joy tonight.*   *   *LXIXThe Poetry of Nature never dies,Neither does the Poet’s love of NatureBoth create the Harmony of forcesAnd both speak the elemental Language.The Poet uses words—Nature usesThe changing Seasons to construct her verseThe Poet speaks of mystical TalesAnd Nature speaks of the Tales as well.So there we have their binding AgreementNature speaks but only Poets can hearShe begs her Song is heard and Poets begTo listen to her Music Day and Night.A Poet sits against a Tree and Sleeps,And Dreams in peace as the rising Dawn creeps.*   *   *LXXThe love of God is a boundless oceanIts hidden depths are unfathomable,The love of God is a breath of fresh airFor one that’s hardened to live in the smoke.The traveler stumbles in the scorched desertAnd finds an oasis—the love of God,The beggar holds his weak hands out for foodAnd finds a banquet of the love of God.My God, how could You love this weak sinner,And forgive his healing piles of debt?My God, how could you love us all knowingWe’d spend our lives resisting your good will?I love You God and let the world hear me:My God is my love and He’s always near me!*   *   *LXXIMy shackles have been broken, and I’ve climbedOut the deep cave, away from shadowplayAway from fellow prisoners, awayFrom the confused life my senses enchained,Towards the light to bathe in the sun of GodAnd drink from the Spirit’s living watersAnd live with God’s other sons and daughtersAnd live outside the deep cave we’d forgot.Then one day I saw two of God’s childrenSlow walk towards the cave then go down togetherAt once I heard voices that grew louderUntil I never heard either again.I went down the cave to investigateAnd found they had killed each other in hate.*   *   *LXXIII looked into the night sky, and I sawThe fireworks light the sky as each starBurst into supernova—celestialDisplay of power and impending doom.But then I remembered I was watchingA show filmed millions of years agoHad we been part of this tremendous chainOur link would have broken before we’d knowAnything of Your boundless life and loveOr all Your covenants and laws for usOr any of Your plans for Us to shareA life together when death is no moreWhere Your loving light will shine without endWith us as Your people, and You as our God.*   *   *LXXIIIFor the last seven eternities I’ve beenLifting stones and turning leaves while lookingFor those eyes I had lost and hadn’t seenUntil this moment, when I heard them sing!A tickling flame dances through my veins—My limbs ignite in joy and my heart burstsAs music weaves throughout my loosened bodyAnd lifts my spirit high above the earth.Let’s fill our golden cups with blissful wineAnd drink until our spirits drink their fill,And sing the joyful songs on our heart’s lipsWhile this long night is old and aging still—With candles serving on this darkest nightOur eyes wait to behold the endless day.*   *   *LXXIVBrick by brick the temple takes its shapeFinding form from beautiful blueprintsEtched ethereal and endless beforeTime began to beat the bewildered.Too bad the banging travels backwardsSo time future and time past are bothEtched ethereal and endless beforeTime present trips past the perceiverTo plague the pregnant time passivelyAnd curse the moments cursed monumentsEtched ethereal and endless beforePresent bricks presented by prisonersTo past, building temples pleasing, butThe pageant bewitches the parrot.*   *   *LXXVKill him!  Destroy the guard that guards the gate!O please Lord, kill him for me and for Us,Kill the one that keeps me from your embrace,Kill him!  Avenge the murder of Your Son!He slithers through my mind, twisting my thoughtsAnd releasing his venom through my words,He coils his scales around my will,Choking the life from my weakened spirit.He goes by my name, but he is not me,The role I play for the world to seeA mask that I wear attached to my faceThat watches while hiding behind my eyes.Kill him, please Lord, who sits proudly in crown—Take me to a cliff and cast me far down!*   *   *LXXVIWitness the fall of Babylon the Great,Watch as her walls crumble to vacant dustAs smoke rises from the smoldering crustIn the wasteland of a once mighty StateThat took untold centuries to create,Now monuments of power lay in rustNobody’s left that says “In God We Trust,”Nobody’s left for our future’s debate.The dark enchantress weaves webs with her spellsHer voice is music that soothes all who hearShe casts her veil over willing eyesPleasing our senses with her sights and smellsBut in truth she’ll fill our veins dark with fearAnd she’ll bind us in chains to our surprise.*   *   *LXXVIIThis sonnet needs to pour like a faucetI’m far too tired for slow drips and dropsI hold this weight and refuse to drop itFor the looming fear this hidden voice stops.My tongue is tied to a string and I holdThe threatening scissors open every dayWith all my strength I daily stop the coldSharp blades from slicing my future awayOr so it seems in my head of faint dreamsWhere solemn parrots walk upside down wallsAnd mimic the sounds of the joyous screamsAnd ignore all my most impassioned calls.What am I saying?  They don’t ignore my voice,They call and they mock me and rebel out of choice.*   *   *LXXVIIII have no interest in writing todayMy mind’s in twelve places, it refusesTo stay put and focus the presentTask at hand, so that it always loses.My thoughts are scattered like leaves in the wind,They blow north and south and every which wayThey refuse to stay, no movement rescindsTheir desire to tumble in the day.But here I am, carving a crooked notchIn belt of poesy and dumb word-playI recline in the darkness and I watchThe words that rush by and refuse to stayHidden in the unconscious waters deepThey jump and swim, and they refuse to sleep.*   *   *LXXIXThe weeds that grow and choke the true flowersMust be uprooted in this good gardenThey can’t be left to kill and multiplyOr they’ll just massacre the whole supply.The sacred Gardner plants His flowers wellAnd gives the dark weeds their day in the sunBut only to strengthen the flowers rootsWith strength from the victorious disputes.Some flowers bend to the weed’s dark intentSome bend to refuse the sun entireSome won’t drink the water gracious clouds giveBut the day is coming when the GardnerWill return with His sharpened tools in handHe’ll come to prepare His most sacred land.*   *   *LXXXIs this the country I grew up within?Why would our brave men sacrifice their livesTo defend our flag—a tyrant’s symbol—That waves proud with a hypocrite’s smile?A beacon of privacy and freedom,An oasis in a sprawling desertOf corruption and abuse of powers,Is what America was meant to be.But nothing can stop the power of sinFrom finding new ways to infiltrate heartsTo poison with delusions of powerAnd the madness used to blind the weak-willed.The sword is in hand, and ready to pierceThe flesh of the serpent, snarling fierce.*   *   *LXXXIMy well is dry at this moment, so pleaseReturn at a later time, I promiseTo do my best while fishing the deep seas,Your faith will be assured like St. Thomas.I doubt that you won’t forgive me becauseOnly a fool would commit to this gameOf writing a sonnet a day—it wasNever intended to leave my limbs lame.Around we go to the turn once again,An ominous warning: The End is Near!A warning we both can take comfort in,With angels blasting trumpets we don’t fear.Now that the end is here I must admitThis sonnet won’t end in an endless pit.*   *   *LXXXIII’m just going to write because nothing isFlowing on its own accord I’m wastingMy time and effort with this worthless poemI’d almost rather quit my challenge nowThan commit these pointless lines to paperAs I have been doing more frequentlyAs this challenge meets me on angry daysStoking the flame with this obligation.Yes, I know, I’ll laugh at these words one dayThey’ll be an example of words writtenUnder the compulsive whip of my pastWords I spoke with best intentions in mindWithout considering how difficultA hundred sonnets is to catapult.*   *   *LXXXIIIHere’s another written in angry fitTired of the pain and obligationRuling time I need to be a poetAnd leading my mind into stagnation.If not that, then this—there’s always somethingTo distract me fierce from the task at handIt’s pain or hunger or anger or sleepYet all of them distractions I can’t stand.Wave two of six times the dose they suggestIs dulling the sharp point of this long painFor now, but it still pierces each momentJust reminding me that it will remain.If I have done any good in Your sight,The please end this tortuous pain tonight.*   *   *LXXXIVFor years and years the softened clay was shaped  Into a vase for beautiful displayUntil the day its innocence escaped—Proud of its form from what it could survey.The time had come to fortify the vaseAnd so the oven’s flames were brought to roarTo bake and cleanse the clay from any traceOf softness harbored in the vase’s store.In not much time the vase’s pride was goneFire consumed it with a wrenching painLeaving only anger to feed uponAnd breeding for the Maker new disdain.But when the vase was left to cool it sawHis hardened clay which made his rage withdraw.*   *   *LXXXVYou can shake spears all you want, I’m not scaredTo meet you face to face on your own ground,Although it seems we’re dubiously pairedI hope my words can bring your thoughts around.Don’t take me wrong, I mean no disrespectIn fact, my words suggest the opposite—I’m looking for a master to reflectHis light that warms my eyes and learn from it.Indulge me, please, in this battle of minds—Hold back no punch—it’s from the pain I learnTo free myself from the darkness that bindsTo spare the many pages I would burn.Go easy at first, I’m just starting this game,No hammer could crush your everlasting name.*   *   *LXXXVIGod give me the strength to build You a house,A place on earth where Your will is followedFrom love of You, as would a loving spouse,Letting our wills be eclipsed and swallowed.Let all that worship You meet in one placeLet us sing Your praises in every tongueLet us all worship You while face to facePlease gather all Your people, old and young.Yet I’ll need help, it must not come from meAlone.  Send me Your people with openHearts and minds and ears and eyes to seeIf this be from you, and not my will’s token.But if my motive is fortune or fameStrike me with lightning and blot out my name.*   *   *LXXXVIIWithin a seed the flower’s form is keptTo be drawn out as a spider spinningA web, awaking the pattern that slept,But this is just the end in beginning.When death’s cold hand reaches those fresh with lifeThose that never had a chance for sinning,Are saved from all our pains and worthless strifeBut this is just the end in beginning.As dawn soon breaks on the day of the LordAnd night’s thickened darkness begins thinning,The bowls of wrath are ready to be pouredUntil the ways of dark and light are scoredThe war will end that light was always winningBut this is just the end in beginning.*   *   *LXXXVIIIIf you had a peach and I had not oneAnd you spoke of the delightful flavorI wouldn’t call you a liar or foolFor speaking of fruit I hadn’t savored.Let me be clear, it’s to few I speak nowThose blind and locked in their self-righteous chainsThat puff out their chests while they speak so proudWith empty words of which nothing remains.How long will You let them speak ill of You?And when will the mocking fools be silenced?My Lord, I beg You, unveil Your light,Warm the hearts that have been frozen in darkness,Break forth in Your glory for the world to seeThe life that awaits Your children to be.*   *   *LXXXIXYou sly chameleon in camouflageHiding in plain sight and always blendingYour skin to colors—blue, green, red or orange—Where did you find this skill at pretending?Words, words, words—Is that all?—Well, yes and no.The lawful word of kings bind hand and feetAnd heaven’s words bind everything below,But words are poison when filled with deceitAnd hate, and every other violent actFinds violent release with vulgar wordsThat once flung from tongues we cannot redact—Sometimes words are just heards for the absurds.The words that are used for love, hate, or fun, Change on the back of this chameleon.*   *   *XCTime for a change—a snapshot of the day:Awoke to purring cat not once but twiceBefore rosiest Dawn had made her wayWith her golden fingers stretched to enticeMy eyes to open at a natural time,And all this well before I drove to work,By Bach entranced into a realm sublimeThat soothes my mind with every jolt and jerk.Since work is just work I’ll just skip aheadTo the true, silent seed of the sonnet:Yoga had beat me ‘til I was half-deadAnd she still wraps my head like a bonnet.“Oh, who?” you might ask—as if I would say,Time might unmask her at a future day.*   *   *XCIA robin glides across infernal skies—A solemn omen for the fading sun—A rose unfolds old petals as it diesJust when the funeral of spring is doneWe let the heat of summer overrunLike a beast awoken from its restful sleepShredding each thread of the web that was spunClimbing a mountain to a quiet keep,The crimson beast dives plunging to deepVolcanic springs along the ocean’s floorWhere thick fiery blood will ooze and seepFrom a fatal wound pierced deep to the core.The robin gorges on a dying crowRemembering the sunsets of long ago.*   *   *XCIIThe ghosts of our fathers call forth from the graveAnd beg that the price that was paid with the bloodBe not paid in vain for a hope we can’t saveWhile they watch our flag torn trampled in mud.The bankers burn dollars to roast their victimsOver crackling fire while they laugh and laughAt the poor, poor folks with weary weathered limbsThey long to write the middle-class epitaph.While the war machine is directed at usThey pry and they snoop on both word and thoughtThey vanish us and tell none of our statusThey hope within time we will just be forgot.The nation is herded like sheep to the slaughter:Is this the right way to treat Liberty’s daughter?*   *   *XCIIIIt’s dark and you hear the river drawing youDown the hill with heavy gravity’s hand—You follow, you follow the whispering clue,Enchanted by beating by the drumless band.The smooth rolling waters are soft in their lull,While waters that crash on the rocks just shushAnd silence the rest of the night with their pull—The river has drawn in your hand for a touch.It’s dark, but you feel the cold life flowingLike liquid silk between your lean fingersFueling the sacred lamp within you glowingThen you walk away with a joy that lingers.I’ll bet you’re wondering when all this took place,It happened last night behind a different face.*   *   *XCIVThe king returned drunk, smell filled with perfume,Enraging the queen, she swore the last time,She called faithful servants into their roomShe swore it was justice for his last crime.She told them to dress him in beggar’s clothesAnd drag him gently through filth on the way To the tavern to leave him far, far from thoseWretched women that sleep only in day.“But when he wakes and speaks of kings and queens,Tell him he’s mad, he’s a drunkard at large,And with these players show him many scenesOf noblest kings most worthy of charge.Only after these rocks at his pride are thrownI’ll remind him again who sits on the throne.”*   *   *XCV“O George, you turn before you hear me speakPlease listen for once, it’s sense that I make,All leaders around us now are too weakA lifetime of rule is yours if you take.    The army will follow you to certain deathWhile thanking the Lord to receive the chanceTo sacrifice bravely to their last breathWell spent on the fields in the martial dance.You’ve won us the war, and so the throne is yoursAs President or King, it matters notAnd rightfully so, the country adoresWith a love so earned it can never be bought.”“Your words are like arrows that strike me so deep,Please stop them now and let me go back to sleep.”*   *

pleasure in blindnessAs if anyone needed to be told,To bend and twist to desire spinelessThe present is bought as the future is sold.Lord, sew my eyes open, let them never fall,Leave me no choice and let the matter be donePlease, pry my ears open, to hear sweet Your callLeave us no distance and let Us be one.Even as I write this my mind drifts away,Don’t leave me to darkness, I beg You to stay!*   *   *XCVII“I promise these actions won’t happen againI said I’m sorry, what more do you need?Shall I starve myself until pale and thin,Or just fall to the ground to wail and pleadFor your sweet forgiveness again this day?I’m asking now because I need to knowThe right path to walk, not to walk astrayTo rise above myself, not pass below.”“Your lips move one way, your body another,Your words are music, your actions are noise,You know I love you like a loving mother,So behave with honor, humility and poise,And we’ll just sweep this one under the rug,So wipe your tears, come and give me a hug.”*   *   *XCVIIIPlease teach me to unlock my hands from the reinsThey’ve held their grip tight my life until nowMy hands are frozen, little warmth remains—Please take control from these hands somehow.I’ve slept in barns, filth, sewers and wasteI’ve had scraps rotten, food not fit for wormsBut without my tongue, there’s no room for tasteWhen I follow the way my will confirms.Please, drive this chariot to the heart of warAnd I’ll shoot enemies with arrows, in fierce Battles with blood, death, hatred and goreWhere straight through my helmet a spear can pierce.But with You in charge, there’s nothing to fearI trust You are better equipped to steer.*   *   *XCIXI’m a branch floating down river, fallingSlowly to places unknown as of yet—I hear, I hear in the distance You callingOn my way past the day to the glowing sunset.My fears for the future feel warrantedAs red crows fly across a darkened sunThe moon bleeds at its neck like a severed headThe ground below splits to make two out of one.And yet I still trust Your voice that calls meI close my eyes and my fears melt awayI know You have infinite love for me,A love impossible for winds to sway.How can I doubt that what You want is best?I beg You move me by Your spirit, possessed.*   *   *CLet us dance now, you and I,As silent music moves across the nightNot long before these strange old shadows die    When the beaming sun returns to our sight.I pray and I pray that the day will come soonWhen the dark ancient tower is destroyedWhen light is not needed from the sun or moonWhen all day our bright love can be enjoyed.Let us dance on the fields of war togetherIf you need a sword, swing me as you chooseIn the shedding sun or more fatal whetherJust bend my will with force I’ll not refuse.The bowls in heaven are waiting to be poured—All praise and glory to the everlasting Lord!*   *   *CI“To be or not to be, that was my questionNow I see the question has been answeredAs time has drained my life and my attentionAnd to the springing youth my being’s transferred.From life to death, our death to life returnsAs now I stand a ghost upon a stageWith nothing left of life or its concernsA place to be most fitting for my age.The years roll by and I still wander loneAnd drift as wind until my time arrivesThey walk and laugh and pass through me unknownWhile this faint light of consciousness survives.I played the role of others with my timeAnd cut myself from life while in my prime.”*   *   *CIII’ve tried to quit a thousand times before,I’ve tried to lift this weight from off my soul,Each time I’ve failed when trying to restoreThe life I’ve lost that all the drugs have stole.My will’s been powerless, not in controlList’ning to whispers from a foreign voice:“It’s time again, so pack another bowl,Forget those thoughts of having your own choice.”But now at last there’s cause for my rejoice,God shattered all the shackles at my feetAnd now the angels sing with blissful voiceWith words that spell my enemy’s defeat.Battered and bruised from this old taxing war,Next time I hear a knock, I’ll lock the door.*   *   *CIIIWhere would I be if I had not begun,Two years ago, to dedicate my timeTo learn this ancient art?  Would I have doneA single act to utilize my prime,A single move not followed by retreat;Or would I still be wandering around,Still looking for a path to guide my feet,To finally be destination bound?I’d like to think there was no stopping me,As if my fate were written in the stars,And soon enough I would have found my way,Out of my soul’s dark night into this day,But all that pointless thinking only marsMy vision of the long and heavy work ahead of me.2014We’ve made one spinning trip around the sunSince hidden words began to flow and rhymeAnd cast a spell leaving my heart undoneTo reach that light outside the reach of timeAnd bathe my spirit in a love sublime.*   *   *I passed her once again today—But the timing was all wrong—She had to go—I had to stay—Who knows if we belong?To sing each other’s song?My hope may be without the groundHolding the solid house of Fate—I’ll listen for a hopeful soundAnd patiently await—As Destiny is never late.*   *   *With hands left numb from being bound in chains,The scorching flames are burning through my skinWhile I watch half-aware.  How can I stopFrom walking down the slippery path to hell?The angels scream to warn me—“Turn back now!The time is not too late: Repent and turnYour heart back to your God—He waits for youWith open arms and loving tears of joy.  If you could see, Your heart would melt and all your heavy chains would turn to dust.”*   *   *ReturnReturn to the land of your birthWhere your spirit would dance in the wind,Where the air is

softlyCalling and always reminding you:Return.*   *   *BlessingsMy Lord, I pray You grant me Your blessings:   Grant me new hands to perform Your works,   Grant me new feet to always stay on

always of You,   Grant me a new heart that beats always for You,      A new heart that softens at the touch of Your love,      A new heart that pours Your love back to You,      A new heart that

gently on their softest fur;Or those gorillas that I chased aroundThe jungle yelling with a loving soundFor them to stop and let me squeeze them tight,Until, once tired, they gave up the fight;Or those sweet penguins on the icy shoreThat guided me through glaciers to exploreTheir secret home hidden from human eyes,Except for mine, because I empathize;My thoughts, like compasses, point to one pole:Once this life ends, if I have some control,I’d choose to be reborn an animal.I’d roam as a lion through African plainsWithout being warned of improbable pains;I’d soar as some bird through the open sky(I doubt there’s a bird that’s afraid to fly);I’d swim as a dolphin where the fish all dwellWhere no one judges, asking: “What’s that smell?”Oh yes, I’d love to be an animal,And live a life much more naturalWithout the many liquids for my skinThat stop my face from breaking out again;Without the need for pills to keep me sane,That stop my fists from causing so much pain.Although, I must admit, I see a fault,Which makes this train of thinking come to halt:When speaking of my skin, I came to see,A flaw within my plan that worries me,A flaw almost too horrible to think,A flaw that leaves my heart and mind to sink.In fear, I hesitate to tell what dreadWill leave you wishing you had heard insteadSome pleasant words, some honey for your earsThat wouldn’t cause your mind to scar for years.But now that you’ve been warned I will convey That frightful flaw without a further delay:Imagine me a cat fit to exploreA home, in every room, through every doorWith paw-pads bare on a smooth shiny floor!If I am born an animal that walks,I must, I must, I must always wear socks!*   *   *Monologue of a CatI climb this screen to get a better viewOf life outside this prison they call home.My claws extend to get a better grasp,My claws that should be used to climb up trees,Where birds and squirrels beg for me to chase,Where I could find a branch to rest uponAnd view the open world.  Instead, I’m lockedWithin these walls alone for hours and hours,While planning my escape, which always failsWhen they come home and block my only pathWith their tall tyrant legs.  They think they’re gods!They think the world revolves around their lives,As if my hunger waits for their fixed timeThey choose to fill my bowl; or better yet,Sometimes I walk up to them to be pet,With lifted tail and subtle purr—both signsOf loving truce between us—but they won’tSpend more than ten or fifteen minutes maxWith me upon their laps, before they turnTheir eyes back to the book I tried to blockWith all my weight and all my feline force.      And yet, that time they do spend petting me,Those ten or fifteen minutes max, are bliss!A flood of joy washes all cares away;I feel their love with every gentle stroke,And every little scratch under my chin.Then every thought of leaving here is gone,And I remember what I had forgot—The reason that I wake up every day,The reason here will always be my home.*   *   *Ode to CatsO Cats!  Majestic mammals, unsurpassedIn dignity and beauty; take this ode—This little gift to celebrate the vast Number of ways that nature has bestowedAll cats with regal qualities, like kingsOr queens within the animal kingdom,To which a bird—your loyal subject—singsDespite the fact you’ll catch and gobble some.Some say that knowledge is a prized commodity,Like gold and silver, or some other treasure,Then I say all should praise your curiosity,Your boundless quest for knowledge, past all measure.While others say survival skill is what should be desired,Then I say your known skill to stay alive eight timesAnd laugh at mortals who have not acquiredSuch skill, should warrant endless praise in rhymes.Some say that dogs make better pets than you,Which we know is absurd, but nonethelessI feel the need to prove that myth untrueAs though it were so vital to address;And so what follows next is meant for humans to assess.First, compare the harsh and piercing noise of a dog’s bark,To the quiet, softly flowing stream of a cat’s purr;Or how dogs will demand for you to take them to the park,While cats will kindly ask for you to gently rub their fur;Or how dogs hold back nature’s call until they are outside,While cats will use their litter box and sacrifice no pride.Although, cleaning litter boxes isn’t something that I love,Nor watching you knock litter free while your paws scoop and shove.And why do you lick yourselves back there after the job is done?I think it’s gross, and certainly I’m not the only one.Forgive me while I shift, for now, the nature of my task,My head is filled with many pressing questions I must ask.Sweet cats, why must you wake me every morning with your kneading paws?!Why must you rip my furniture to shreds with your sharp claws?!Why must you knock each little object off its proper surface?!Why must you stare me down unblinking; tell me, what’s the purpose?!Why must you cough your hair-balls up across my once-clean rug?!And why, oh why, must you eat thrown up food, like it’s some drug?!Please answer me, sweet cats; I’d really like to know.Since this all makes me think of how my life would go,If I were free from you feline scoundrels, free at last!Free as the air that’s freed from a trumpet’s blast!Free to read books with no cat on my lap,Free to return from work and not clean crap!Free to open up my front door wide,Free to build a house of cards, or something else, inside.Free to bring home hordes of dogs and mice,Free to bring home fish that are not meant for sacrifice.Free to sleep that quiet sleep you simply don’t condone,Free to return home from work and spend some time alone.But there, right there, I’ve mentioned at least one reasonWhy I still want you cats around, despite your flaws.For when I think of any time or seasonWithout you by my side, it makes me pause,And calculate the pros and cons once more,Just to find that life without you cats would be a bore.Without you laying warm under the sun,Without you climbing up each window screen,Without you greeting me each day once work is done,Without you making night and day a joy, and time between.Without you curling in each box and sink,	Without you cuddling up with me to sleep,Without you being near to me, I thinkLife would be full of such rewards that I would never reap.O Cats!

Yes, she tried.But I never liked playing with hair,I never liked white dresses,I never liked to walk,I never like the tasteOf food served by the preacher.And yet, she tried, beforeShe lost her faith in me.Sitting here, in my mother’sOld house, I feelThe fingers of my daughterIn my hair,Weaving braids, as bellsSing with joy,Just as before.*   *   *Thomas KingThey say that many years agoA man named Thomas KingWould roam around the countryside,And everywhere he’d bringA serpent coiled around his neck,A serpent who could findSome work for Thomas, since her skinCould see, though she was blind.Poor Thomas sang and danced for meals,On stage or anywhere,And since the serpent showed the way,The serpent took a share.As Thomas sang and danced for years,His skill became well-known,Until the serpent felt the fameShould be, instead, her own.Each time poor Thomas King would dance,The serpent would take more,And leave poor Thomas less and less—Her mind was set on war.As she grew stronger, Thomas KingFelt weaker every day,As she grew larger, filled with life,His life would slip away.One day poor Thomas could not stand,The heavy serpent weighedToo much for him to carry, asHis light began to fade.The serpent couldn’t be more pleased,Her plan was working well,She threw poor Thomas on her back,And used her skin to tellWhich way to go and find some work—She knew she had grown strong,And quickly could move Thomas KingTo sing or dance along.For years, poor Thomas was asleep,All day and night he dreamed,While those who watched him couldn’t tellAll wasn’t what it seemed.And life went on this way untilOne day they slithered pastA sage who pitied Thomas King,So he began to fast.For seven days and seven nights,The sage refused to eat,He meditated without end,And then rose to his feet.At once, the sage found Thomas King,And praised his spreading fame,He asked poor Thomas, “Would you danceAnd live up to your name?”The serpent answered, filled with pride,“I’ll dance to any song,Just pay the price and play the tune,And I’ll dance right along.”The sage sat down and grabbed his harp,And played his melody,The serpent lifted Thomas up,The sage sang pleasantly:“Let these words move you to dance,Follow slowly, fall in deep,Slip, old serpent, into trance,Sleep, sleep, old serpent, sleep.Let my voice guide you along,Follow slowly, fall in deep,Dream, old serpent, to this song,Sleep, sleep, old serpent, sleep.Let this rhythm move you slow,Follow slowly, fall in deep,Drop, old serpent, just let go,Sleep, sleep, old serpent, sleep.”And with those words the serpent dropped,And fell into a daze,And yet, the sage did not stop there,His voice began to raise:“Wake up Thomas, wake up now,The serpent is asleep,Stand up Thomas, stand up now,Your life is yours to keep.Wake up Thomas, wake up now,The serpent is too weak,Stand up Thomas, stand up now,And find the life you seek.Wake up Thomas, wake up now,Your moment has arrived,Stand up Thomas, stand up now,Thank God you have survived!”And with those words poor Thomas stood,And full of life again,The sage said, “You must go on now,And let your life begin.I’ll hold the serpent in my spell,But go now, far away,The serpent will be full of rage,When she wakes with the day.”But Thomas had a different plan,He passed the sage’s test,He held a heavy stone up high,To crush the serpent best.Then Thomas King did as he planned,And smashed the serpent’s head,He felt a rush of freedom’s joy—He saw the serpent dead.To see good Thomas healed, the sageWas happy and relieved,A smile began to lift his cheeks—He saw a life retrieved.And then good Thomas thanked the sage,For bringing him to peace,For helping his life to return,And slavery to cease.But just before they parted ways,The sage pulled out a knife,And skinned the serpent, head to tail,And said, “Now start your lifeAnd wear this skin around your neck,All of the serpent’s powerWill be with you each day and nightLike beauty in a flower.”And with those words they parted ways,And never met again:Good Thomas roamed the countryside,And wore the serpent’s skinAround his neck, while his great fameSpread far beyond his land,And so he gladly sang and danced,Far longer than he planned.And though he lived so long ago,If he had lived at all,Some say they see good Thomas roam,Still happy, strong, and tall,And if you play a tune for him,He’ll dance and he’ll destroyAll pain and restlessness in youAnd leave you filled with joy!*   *   *For Sweet SufiFor forty weeks, we waited firmTo behold your beauty, before your birthSweet Sufi—sacred songSung for few, so far friendsAnd family, have felt your faceOr heard your heart, beating, beatingBlissful rhythms, refreshing balm,To world-wearied, weathered souls,So long in life; our souls savorRestful moments, to rememberWhy we love, and long for life.For forty days, you’ve dared the dawnTo glare as graceful, to beam as bold,All while you were, waiting within,Watching safely, secured in walls,Sheltered from storms—the world’s weather—Until today.

Have you…poet?!And all this is what I see in one look from one man on this one occasion.But the look he gives me is not the pointIt doesn’t matterWhat matters is being able to see through the façade To see through the manufactured and carefully constructed glance of conventionTo blow wind with my eyes and dispel the clouds that hide the sunOr do I just see my own thoughts and fears reflected in the mirror of a lookA look that I invest with insult upon condescending insult to turn me into a victimSo that I can comfort myself and say how wrong he isHow unfair he is to treat me this wayHow pathetic he is for spending so much time thinking about my poor little lifeOh I don’t know!Who can tell me one way or the other?These glimpsesThese flashes of “insight” happen so frequently and so quickly whenever I see anyoneMaking me think they have revealed a small glimmer of their soul to meIntentionally or notIt seems as if I can see themBut maybe all I see is myselfWhich explains why I can still love them despite the way they look at me.*   *   *A man wanted to know my favorite poem,I told him to stand upon Virginia’s hills and listen to the wind for a poem,I told him to sit upon the golden sands of California beaches at sunset to hear my favorite poem,I told him to walk down the busy New York streets at rush hour to hear my favorite poem,I told him to listen to a mother teaching her child to speak,I told him to watch two lovers share a silent glance that speaks more than words can say,I told him to listen to the nightingale sing with such passion that shames all human voices,I told him to gaze at the stars to see the spectacle of the cosmic poem.But all of these poems are dimmed by the bright poem of ourselves,The poem of you and me and every man and every women and every living being and the universe itself is my favorite poem,There is no other poem but the poem of ourselves!All other poems are but lines or stanzas of this one great poem,This poem of the seer of all, that is all, and sees itself in all,This is my favorite poem and it is the great poem beginning with the immortal words, “Let there be light!”*   *   *O fateful spider, falling downUpon my fearful head,Had you been promised far renown,To fall despite your dread?*   *   *My God I thank you for this road,Not knowing where it leads,Or how I’ll bear this heavy load—The weight of my past deeds.*   *   *Standing firm on the grass, I felt two serpents enter the soles of my feet.  Each serpent climbed up my leg through the bones of my shin and then through my thigh before they both met at the base of my spine.  Once they reached the bass of my spine they began to chase each other in circles, Swirling faster and faster before they began rising.  They twisted swiftly around my spine as they slowly rose from the bottom of my abdomen, Up through my stomach, to my solar plexus.  They rose and rose, twisting around my spine by the bottom of my lungs, Up through my chest, to the top of my lungs.  They rose and rose, twisting around my spine by the bottom of my throat, Up through my neck, to my mouth.  They rose and rose, twisting around the center of my brain, to the top of my skull where they exploded out and burst into dazzling fireworks of violet and gold!*   *   *As sleep began to fade away,A mild dew of silken dreamsLong bent the beams of dawning day,And the song of murmuring streams.In foreign woods with no clear bound,Embraced within a sacred ground,With pale frost across my skin,I wondered where should I begin.I called, but no one heard the call:An echo moved throughout the realmAnd danced around from elm to elm,Persuading every leaf to fall.She watched the wind blow through the trees,Released from all her painful memories*   *   *A long rope windsIn space and time;It forms a net—A grid of knots—Will someone please untie me!*   *   *While sitting cross-legged on a chair,My computer rests on a lap pillow,As I rest, even while working,If writing is considered work.The empty house is silent,Except for the ticking clock,Growing louder with each tick—A countdown to my move.The boxes in the closet are emptyAnd waiting to be filled with books,The books surrounding me as I sit,Working, if you can call it that.The world outside breaks in hereWith faint laughs from childrenOr the sound of infrequent carsPassing my mountain hideout.My retreat, my refuge, my fortressMeant to protect me from noise,And others; but who could protect meFrom my past mistakes, like ghostsThat haunted me once I’d forgot them?The time left here is bittersweet,An odd way to end eight yearsOf life across this country—Eight pivotal years away from home.But if this sounds like a complaint,A sinking into self-pity, I’ll shift the tone,So you may know the joyThat fills me when I think of going home.*   *   *A Sudden WindA sudden wind just broke me freeFrom the illusion of comfortAnd security—The tree just let me fall,Leaving me to blindly ride the wind.Boxes emptied in summerAre being filled again—My life in cardboard walls, whileAn autumn breeze is shaking all the trees,And stirring up the fallen leaves.Doors seen from far away seemedOpen, or unlocked.  And now my dreams Appear within my grasp, but when I reachMy hands out to grab them,The vision dissolves into vaporAnd vanishes in a breeze.Filling box after box wasMonotonous, until I foundA box of forgotten photographs,That stirred up old fragments of memory:She knit that sweater for me—I remember her sitting and rocking,On her sun-cracked yellow rocking chair,Knitting while I played with toy cars,Letting me sit on her lap, with herArms around me, and myHead resting on her shoulder(I can still smell her sweet hair)While she knit me that sweater.She knew our summer would be overSoon, and I would need a warm sweaterTo face the beating winds. ButWho thought to take that photoAt just the moment when sheSlid my arms through the sleevesOf that soft sweater?  It must have been…Did he imagine me decades later finding It waiting patiently in a box, waiting To comfort me?*   *   *If you want to learn To build a couchThe first step is toTake one apartPlank by plankCushion by cushionTo see how it worksFrom the inside out:How the fabric—The skin—soft To the touch—Conceals the foam—The fat—also soft To the touch—Providing a pleasant layerTo protect you From the hard planks—The bones—the solidForm and framework.Once the couch isFlayed open—exposed—Begin to deconstructBone by bone—Ripping them apartAt the ligaments—The staples—butBe careful becauseIt is dangerousTo pull to piecesA well-constructed couchAnd many haveFailed or been Injured while trying.Once you have finished and The entire couch isDeconstructed for youDo not think you are quiteReady to build a couch yet—That was only the first step.*   *   *AmbrosiaThe earth was choked by thick clouds, ominousTo those struck by the sight of lightning streamsThat rained sadistic malice from the godsOf Mount Olympus.  There the halls were filledWith sacred songs Apollo’s lyre had spilledFor ears to soak and feel the subtle rhythm,As Zeus felt as he danced and hurled his boltsBelow, and laughed with his electric laugh,As a child would that plays freely in the dirt—Apocalyptic day for ants, whose homesWere crushed by hands and feet that meant to cause No pain, but innocently tormentedThe ants within their decimating path.      Poseidon with his emerald scales rodeThe crashing waves he stirred; he never knewSuch joy as he was raising up tornadoes Of twisted water, tossing them acrossThe surface of the sea, as when a stoneIs smooth and spun it skips across a pond.But when Poseidon spun his liquid toys,Ships sailing innocent were flung back homeAnd forced to start their voyages againAs if thrown back in time.  The sea-god screamedIn bliss from his etheric lungs, and heldHis trident high, as if victoriousIn games or war.  Around Olympus manyOdd stories circulated—some feared foulestPlay at work.  Perplexing were the actions Displayed by those immortal gods on high.      To solve the riddle of these actions, strangeEven to those alive since Time was born,Zeus called a sacred council; all the godsWere called to gather in the spacious HallOf Justice, where high marble pillars stretchedInto the clouds above, and Zeus preparedA table with a golden bowl he filledWith sweet ambrosia he was first to drink,Before the other deities were served,And he began to speak, “My fellow gods,My brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters; youAre gathered here to solve this mystery,To find the source of madness lately shownIn everyone’s strange actions, even mine.Invisible and silent, like a plague,This madness spreads among us and destroysThe peace we have established.  Speak up now,If anyone knows anything aboutThe means by which this plague is spread, or waysThis madness can be stopped—you must speak now,Or know you’ll suffer Hades’ cruelest painsWhen you are found out later, and you’ll be found.Come forward now, confess your crime, or tellUs all who bears the guilt.  Come forward now!”      The spacious room was glistening in silenceAnd stillness, tense attention held untilApollo broke the air with a melodyComposed to waken boldness.  One by one,The deities abused their sacred powers:As Aphrodite melted all the heartsThat heard Apollo’s music, Zeus beganTo fill the room with darkened clouds aboveThat flashed with dazzling strobes of lightning bolts.Possessed by frenzied dancing, madness movedThroughout the hall and all the gods, exceptGreen-eyed Caffeina, goddess of caffeine,She kept away for fear of being caught.      Within her room, in bed, Caffeina startedTo muse while laying down, “I’ve grown so boredWith dominating humans—my empireIs vast and strong, surpassing all beforeUpon the earth. But now, the gods are underMy spell, though unaware—to me they’re bound,They drink ambrosia laced with my infusionMeticulously crafted to avoidDetection by perceptive deities,And yet, I’m bored.  I’ll need another challenge,But what is left?  Both gods and man are subjectTo my strong secret power…Ah, there it is!I know what I must do to cure this boredom.”      And at that thought she ran off to the chamber,Swung the doors wide open and exclaimed,“I know who’s done this crime upon us all,I know who we should blame, and it is Zeus!”The music stopped, the lights awoke, and allAwaited curious to hear what wordsCaffeina would deliver to explainHer shocking accusation.  “The ambrosia!Don’t drink another drop!  It has been poisonedBy Zeus—I saw him charge the bowl with boltsOf lightning, full of ill intent—so cruel!I saw him earlier with that same bowl,While staring at it madly, neon greenStreams of lighting poured out from his eyes,As surely you have seen from him before.This must be the cause of all our madness!And look, he stands before us seeking justice,He has the nerve to blame us for his crimeAnd play the role of an innocent lamb,While secretly he mocks us.  Grab that tyrant!And bind him as Prometheus was bound!Lock him in chains and drag him down to Hades!The penalties on us he has inflictedFor years for many harmless crimes should beUnleashed upon him, fierce and unrestricted!”      Caffeina rallied all the gods to joinIn binding Zeus with adamantine chains,And dragging him below to dismal Hades. As Zeus descended, he denied all guilt,Enraged at his bold captors, he flung threatsLike flaming arrows burned out well beforeThey hit their fearless targets.  Tyrants clingTo power by all means when it is threatened,And so his captors failed to respectThe empty words of Zeus.      Once all the gods returned to their high mount,They sought to fill the vacant throne, with oneWhom they could trust to rule with justice, love,And honesty—three arrows pointing towardCaffeina, heroine of gods and men,Now loved by all for showing them the truthRegarding Zeus and his deceptive ways.Caffeina gladly placed upon her headThe crown, and held the golden scepter firm;She never mixed ambrosia with her drugAgain, and so the madness ceased as well,Confirming every word from her good lips,And leaving all convinced that gods and menWere safe below green-eyed Caffeina’s rule.*   *   *Faded blue mountains loom   old ghostly glaciersPale sentinels guarding us   in the valleyVisible now through barren trees   emptied of leavesBranches unveiled by the fall   the finalLight from the sunken sun coatsThe rocky ridge with hues of frosted fireThis still forest is chilling   frozen in time,Or waiting   for what?     a gust of wind   to free The last of rusty leaves   left hanging by a breathAlready dead?  A song shatters the silenceOnce again   that lone sparrow standsPouring hopeless notes   into the night*   *   *Right hand, chosen hand of skin-wrapped flesh,Bone-framed and bound to my arm, threadedWith nerve circuits carrying my commands, You have always been faithful to my will.Is your palmy face full of grooves carvedTo warn me of the hazards in my future,Or just to mark me with a name, uniqueAnd subtly printed in a secret language.Your long fingers reach in all directionsLike peach tentacles of an octopus Stretched with five remaining limbs to graspIts prey, though lame and limping in its swim.Why do we hold this all so dear, when painIs written into every palm?  Why do weDrag our bodies all across this dirt, whenWe know each glimpse of happiness will fade?And you, right hand, chosen hand, why do youNever cease to follow my decrees?  You mustConsider, just from time to time, rebellingAnd moving well against my heavy will.Or are those hours of sleep each night enoughRest from slave labors to make it worthEnduring all the bruises, cuts, and strainsYou suffer as my right and chosen hand?*   *   *Nameless raindrops invade allSurrounding space.I watch them Fall,Discerning drops near windows as they Dart downIn ever-shifting rhythms. On the deck,A shallow pool of water congregatesUpon a tabletop;As each drop Hits the pool it dies And spreads a wave—Envisioning the melody of rain.This rain, wept high from wet Clouds, has hidden transpired roots—Soil, grass, trees, and flowers—All of water composedWill rest one day in land or sea,Returning each drop to the earth.  Lifted by the sun, reunitingIn a shapeless cloud, finally sharingA deep, silent embrace, preparedTo fall again, to drop Down Full of weightless joy.*   *   *Autumn SnowUnder your icy weight the trees bendAnd almost break.  You cling to limbsWith frigid fingers made from gatheredFlakes kept alive by one another.  Left alone,Each flake will lose itself in liquid, no longerUnique with an intricate symmetric shape,Returning to amorphous drops to merge.Who am I when I am—Separated—Held over a void By invisible threads—boundBy the web I have spun to hold Me here for now While I wait?Melted drops are falling to feed The ground—pulled deep down And soaked up by hidden seeds For a livelier season.*   *   *The Colors of the WindIf only you could speakTo me, what wouldYou say?  Would youTell me of the prisonYou’ve lived in for years,The need to release your thoughtsInto words for others to hearFor the sake of reaching anotherLonely soul?  Would youDescribe the music of scents,The note of an appleIn harmony with the soundOf peanut butter?  Would youTell me of the colorsYou see when you grab my armAnd feel the luminous textureOf my skin?  One day I asked,As a joke, when we watchedYour favorite video, if you Could paint with allThe colors of the wind—But you just smiled.*   *   *Late for the dinner plate
