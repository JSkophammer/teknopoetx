Sylvia Plath

Ariel


Morning Song





Love set you going like a fat gold watch.

The midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry

Took its place among the elements.





Our voices echo, magnifying your arrival. New statue

In a drafty museum, your nakedness

Shadows our safety. We stand round blankly as walls.





I’m no more your mother

Than the cloud that distils a mirror to reflect its own slow

Effacement at the wind’s hand.





All night your moth-breath

Flickers among the flat pink roses. I wake to listen:

A far sea moves in my ear.





One cry, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral

In my Victorian nightgown.

Your mouth opens clean as a cat’s. The window square





Whitens and swallows its dull stars. And now you try

Your handful of notes;

The clear vowels rise like balloons.





The Couriers





The word of a snail on the plate of a leaf?

It is not mine. Do not accept it.





Acetic acid in a sealed tin?

Do not accept it. It is not genuine.





A ring of gold with the sun in it?

Lies. Lies and a grief.





Frost on a leaf, the immaculate

Cauldron, talking and crackling





All to itself on the top of each

Of nine black Alps,





A disturbance in mirrors,

The sea shattering its grey one——





Love, love, my season.





The Rabbit Catcher





It was a place of force——

The wind gagging my mouth with my own blown hair,

Tearing off my voice, and the sea

Blinding me with its lights, the lives of the dead

Unreeling in it, spreading like oil.





I tasted the malignity of the gorse,

Its black spikes,

The extreme unction of its yellow candle-flowers.

They had an efficiency, a great beauty,

And were extravagant, like torture.





There was only one place to get to.

Simmering, perfumed,

The paths narrowed into the hollow.

And the snares almost effaced themselves——

Zeroes, shutting on nothing,





Set close, like birth pangs.

The absence of shrieks

Made a hole in the hot day, a vacancy.

The glassy light was a clear wall,

The thickets quiet.





I felt a still busyness, an intent.

I felt hands round a tea mug, dull, blunt,

Ringing the white china.

How they awaited him, those little deaths!

They waited like sweethearts. They excited him.





And we, too, had a relationship——

Tight wires between us,

Pegs too deep to uproot, and a mind like a ring

Sliding shut on some quick thing,

The constriction killing me also.





Thalidomide





O half moon——





Half-brain, luminosity——

Negro, masked like a white,





Your dark

Amputations crawl and appal——





Spidery, unsafe.

What glove





What leatheriness

Has protected





Me from that shadow——

The indelible buds,





Knuckles at shoulder-blades, the

Faces that





Shove into being, dragging

The lopped





Blood-caul of absences.

All night I carpenter





A space for the thing I am given,

A love





Of two wet eyes and a screech.

White spit





Of indifference!

The dark fruits revolve and fall.





The glass cracks across,

The image





Flees and aborts like dropped mercury





The Applicant





First, are you our sort of person?

Do you wear

A glass eye, false teeth or a crutch,

A brace or a hook,

Rubber breasts or a rubber crotch,





Stitches to show somethings missing? No, no? Then

How can we give you a thing?

Stop crying.

Open your hand.

Empty? Empty. Here is a hand





To fill it and willing

To bring teacups and roll away headaches

And do whatever you tell it.

Will you marry it?

It is guaranteed





To thumb shut your eyes at the end

And dissolve of sorrow.

We make new stock from the salt.

I notice you are stark naked.

How about this suit





Black and stiff, but not a bad fit.

Will you marry it?

It is waterproof, shatterproof, proof

Against fire and bombs through the roof.

Believe me, theyll bury you in it.





Now your head, excuse me, is empty.

I have the ticket for that.

Come here, sweetie, out of the closet.

Well, what do you think of that?

Naked as paper to start





But in twenty-five years shell be silver,

In fifty, gold.

A living doll, everywhere you look.

It can sew, it can cook,

It can talk, talk, talk.





It works, there is nothing wrong with it.

You have a hole, its a poultice.

You have an eye, its an image.

My boy, its your last resort.

Will you marry it, marry it, marry it.





Barren Woman





Empty, I echo to the least footfall,

Museum without statues, grand with pillars, porticoes, rotundas.

In my courtyard a fountain leaps and sinks back into itself,

Nun-hearted and blind to the world. Marble lilies

Exhale their pallor like scent.





I imagine myself with a great public,

Mother of a white Nike and several bald-eyed Apollos.

Instead, the dead injure me with attentions, and nothing can happen.

The moon lays a hand on my forehead,

Blank-faced and mum as a nurse.





Lady Lazarus





I have done it again.

One year in every ten

I manage it——





A sort of walking miracle, my skin

Bright as a Nazi lampshade,

My right foot





A paperweight,

My face a featureless, fine

Jew linen.





Peel off the napkin

O my enemy.

Do I terrify?——





The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?

The sour breath

Will vanish in a day.





Soon, soon the flesh

The grave cave ate will be

At home on me





And I a smiling woman.

I am only thirty.

And like the cat I have nine times to die.





This is Number Three.

What a trash

To annihilate each decade.





What a million filaments.

The peanut-crunching crowd

Shoves in to see





Them unwrap me hand and foot——

The big strip tease.

Gentlemen, ladies





These are my hands

My knees.

I may be skin and bone,





Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.

The first time it happened I was ten.

It was an accident.





The second time I meant

To last it out and not come back at all.

I rocked shut





As a seashell.

They had to call and call

And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.





Dying

Is an art, like everything else.

I do it exceptionally well.





I do it so it feels like hell.

I do it so it feels real.

I guess you could say I’ve a call.





It’s easy enough to do it in a cell.

It’s easy enough to do it and stay put.

It’s the theatrical





Comeback in broad day

To the same place, the same face, the same brute

Amused shout:





‘A miracle!’

That knocks me out.

There is a charge





For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge

For the hearing of my heart——

It really goes.





And there is a charge, a very large charge

For a word or a touch

Or a bit of blood





Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.

So, so, Herr Doktor.

So, Herr Enemy.





I am your opus,

I am your valuable,

The pure gold baby





That melts to a shriek.

I turn and burn.

Do not think I underestimate your great concern.





Ash, ash——

You poke and stir.

Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——





A cake of soap,

A wedding ring,

A gold filling.





Herr God, Herr Lucifer

Beware

Beware.





Out of the ash

I rise with my red hair

And I eat men like air.





Tulips





The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.

Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.

I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly

As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.

I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.

I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses

And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.





They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff

Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.

Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.

The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,

They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,

Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,

So it is impossible to tell how many there are.





My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water

Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.

They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.

Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage——

My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,

My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;

Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.





I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat

Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.

They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.

Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley

I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books

Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.

I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.





I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted

To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.

How free it is, you have no idea how free——

The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,

And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.

It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them

Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.





The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.

Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe

Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.

Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.

They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down,

Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,

A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.





Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.

The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me

Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,

And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow

Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,

And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.

The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.





Before they came the air was calm enough,

Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.

Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.

Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river

Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.

They concentrate my attention, that was happy

Playing and resting without committing itself.





The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.

The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;

They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,

And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes

Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.

The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,

And comes from a country far away as health.





A Secret





A secret! A secret!

How superior.

You are blue and huge, a traffic policeman,

Holding up one palm——





A difference between us?

I have one eye, you have two.

The secret is stamped on you,

Faint, undulant watermark.





Will it show in the black detector?

Will it come out

Wavery, indelible, true

Through the African giraffe in its Edeny greenery,





The Moroccan hippopotamus?

They stare from a square, stiff frill.

They are for export,

One a fool, the other a fool.





A secret! An extra amber

Brandy finger

Roosting and cooing ‘You, you’

Behind two eyes in which nothing is reflected but monkeys.





A knife that can be taken out

To pare nails,

To lever the dirt.

‘It won’t hurt.’





An illegitimate baby——

That big blue head!

How it breathes in the bureau drawer.

‘Is that lingerie, pet?





‘It smells of salt cod, you had better

Stab a few cloves in an apple,

Make a sachet or

Do away with the bastard.





Do away with it altogether.’

‘No, no, it is happy there.’

‘But it wants to get out!

Look, look! It is wanting to crawl.’





My god, there goes the stopper!

The cars in the Place de la Concorde——

Watch out!

A stampede, a stampede——





Horns twirling, and jungle gutterals.

An exploded bottle of stout,

Slack foam in the lap.

You stumble out,





Dwarf baby,

The knife in your back.

‘I feel weak.’

The secret is out.





The Jailor





My night sweats grease his breakfast plate.

The same placard of blue fog is wheeled into position

With the same trees and headstones.

Is that all he can come up with,

The rattler of keys?





I have been drugged and raped.

Seven hours knocked out of my right mind

Into a black sack

Where I relax, foetus or cat,

Lever of his wet dreams.





Something is gone.

My sleeping capsule, my red and blue zeppelin

Drops me from a terrible altitude.

Carapace smashed,

I spread to the beaks of birds.





O little gimlets——

What holes this papery day is already full of!

He has been burning me with cigarettes,

Pretending I am a negress with pink paws.

I am myself. That is not enough.





The fever trickles and stiffens in my hair.

My ribs show. What have I eaten?

Lies and smiles.

Surely the sky is not that color,

Surely the grass should be rippling.





All day, gluing my church of burnt matchsticks,

I dream of someone else entirely.

And he, for this subversion

Hurts me, he

With his armory of fakery,





His high, cold masks of amnesia.

How did I get here?

Indeterminate criminal,

I die with variety——

Hung, starved, burned, hooked.





I imagine him

Impotent as distant thunder,

In whose shadow I have eaten my ghost ration.

I wish him dead or away.

That, it seems, is the impossibility.





That being free. What would the dark

Do without fevers to eat?

What would the light

Do without eyes to knife, what would he

Do, do, do without me.





Cut




for Susan ONeill Roe





What a thrill

My thumb instead of an onion.

The top quite gone

Except for a sort of a hinge





Of skin,

A flap like a hat,

Dead white.

Then that red plush.





Little pilgrim,

The Indians axed your scalp.

Your turkey wattle

Carpet rolls





Straight from the heart.

I step on it,

Clutching my bottle

Of pink fizz.





A celebration, this is.

Out of a gap

A million soldiers run,

Redcoats, every one.





Whose side are they on?

O my

Homunculus, I am ill.

I have taken a pill to kill





The thin

Papery feeling.

Saboteur,

Kamikaze man





The stain on your

Gauze Ku Klux Klan

Babushka

Darkens and tarnishes and when





The balled

Pulp of your heart

Confronts its small

Mill of silence





How you jump

Trepanned veteran,

Dirty girl,

Thumb stump.





Elm




(for Ruth Fainlight)





I know the bottom, she says. I know it with my great tap root:

It is what you fear.

I do not fear it: I have been there.





Is it the sea you hear in me,

Its dissatisfactions?

Or the voice of nothing, that was your madness?





Love is a shadow.

How you lie and cry after it

Listen: these are its hooves: it has gone off, like a horse.





All night I shall gallop thus, impetuously,

Till your head is a stone, your pillow a little turf,

Echoing, echoing.





Or shall I bring you the sound of poisons?

This is rain now, this big hush.

And this is the fruit of it: tin-white, like arsenic.





I have suffered the atrocity of sunsets.

Scorched to the root

My red filaments burn and stand, a hand of wires.





Now I break up in pieces that fly about like clubs.

A wind of such violence

Will tolerate no bystanding: I must shriek.





The moon, also, is merciless: she would drag me

Cruelly, being barren.

Her radiance scathes me. Or perhaps I have caught her.





I let her go. I let her go

Diminished and flat, as after radical surgery.

How your bad dreams possess and endow me.





I am inhabited by a cry.

Nightly it flaps out

Looking, with its hooks, for something to love.





I am terrified by this dark thing

That sleeps in me;

All day I feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity.





Clouds pass and disperse.

Are those the faces of love, those pale irretrievables?

Is it for such I agitate my heart?





I am incapable of more knowledge.

What is this, this face

So murderous in its strangle of branches?——





Its snaky acids hiss.

It petrifies the will. These are the isolate, slow faults

That kill, that kill, that kill.





The Night Dances





A smile fell in the grass.

Irretrievable!





And how will your night dances

Lose themselves. In mathematics?





Such pure leaps and spirals——

Surely they travel





The world forever, I shall not entirely

Sit emptied of beauties, the gift





Of your small breath, the drenched grass

Smell of your sleeps, lilies, lilies.





Their flesh bears no relation.

Cold folds of ego, the calla,





And the tiger, embellishing itself——

Spots, and a spread of hot petals.





The comets

Have such a space to cross,





Such coldness, forgetfulness.

So your gestures flake off——





Warm and human, then their pink light

Bleeding and peeling





Through the black amnesias of heaven.

Why am I given





These lamps, these planets

Falling like blessings, like flakes





Six-sided, white

On my eyes, my lips, my hair





Touching and melting.

Nowhere.





The Detective





What was she doing when it blew in

Over the seven hills, the red furrow, the blue mountain?

Was she arranging cups? It is important.

Was she at the window, listening?

In that valley the train shrieks echo like souls on hooks.





That is the valley of death, though the cows thrive.

In her garden the lies were shaking out their moist silks

And the eyes of the killer moving sluglike and sidelong,

Unable to face the fingers, those egotists.

The fingers were tamping a woman into a wall,





A body into a pipe, and the smoke rising.

This is the smell of years burning, here in the kitchen,

These are the deceits, tacked up like family photographs,

And this is a man, look at his smile,

The death weapon? No-one is dead.





There is no body in the house at all.

There is the smell of polish, there are plush carpets.

There is the sunlight, playing its blades,

Bored hoodlum in a red room

Where the wireless talks to itself like an elderly relative.





Did it come like an arrow, did it come like a knife?

Which of the poisons is it?

Which of the nerve-curlers, the convulsors? Did it electrify?

This is a case without a body.

The body does not come into it at all.





It is a case of vaporization.

The mouth first, its absence reported

In the second year. It had been insatiable

And in punishment was hung out like brown fruit

To wrinkle and dry.





The breasts next.

These were harder, two white stones.

The milk came yellow, then blue and sweet as water.

There was no absence of lips, there were two children,

But their bones showed, and the moon smiled.





Then the dry wood, the gates,

The brown motherly furrows, the whole estate.

We walk on air, Watson.

There is only the moon, embalmed in phosphorus.

There is only a crow in a tree. Make notes.





Ariel





Stasis in darkness.

Then the substanceless blue

Pour of tor and distances.





Gods lioness,

How one we grow,

Pivot of heels and knees!The furrow





Splits and passes, sister to

The brown arc

Of the neck I cannot catch,





Nigger-eye

Berries cast dark

Hooks





Black sweet blood mouthfuls,

Shadows.

Something else





Hauls me through air

Thighs, hair;

Flakes from my heels.





White

Godiva, I unpeel

Dead hands, dead stringencies.





And now I

Foam to wheat, a glitter of seas.

The childs cry





Melts in the wall.

And I

Am the arrow,





The dew that flies

Suicidal, at one with the drive

Into the red





Eye, the cauldron of morning.





Death & Co.





Two. Of course there are two.

It seems perfectly natural now

The one who never looks up, whose eyes are lidded

And balled, like Blakes,

Who exhibits





The birthmarks that are his trademark

The scald scar of water,

The nude

Verdigris of the condor.

I am red meat. His beak





Claps sidewise: I am not his yet.

He tells me how badly I photograph.

He tells me how sweet

The babies look in their hospital

Icebox, a simple





Frill at the neck,

Then the flutings of their Ionian

Death-gowns,

Then two little feet.

He does not smile or smoke.





The other does that,

His hair long and plausive.

Bastard

Masturbating a glitter,

He wants to be loved.





I do not stir.

The frost makes a flower,

The dew makes a star.

The dead bell,

The dead bell.





Somebodys done for.





Magi





The abstracts hover like dull angels:

Nothing so vulgar as a nose or an eye

Bossing the ethereal blanks of their face-ovals.





Their whiteness bears no relation to laundry,

Snow, chalk or suchlike. Theyre

The real thing, all right: the Good, the True





Salutary and pure as boiled water,

Loveless as the multiplication table.

While the child smiles into thin air.





Six months in the world, and she is able

To rock on all fours like a padded hammock.

For her, the heavy notion of Evil





Attending her cot is less than a belly ache,

And Love the mother of milk, no theory.

They mistake their star, these papery godfolk.





They want the crib of some lamp-headed Plato.

Let them astound his heart with their merit.

What girl ever flourished in such company?





Lesbos





Viciousness in the kitchen!

The potatoes hiss.

It is all Hollywood, windowless,

The fluorescent light wincing on and off like a terrible migraine,

Coy paper strips for doors

Stage curtains, a widows frizz.

And I, love, am a pathological liar,

And my childlook at her, face down on the floor,

Little unstrung puppet, kicking to disappear

Why she is a schizophrenic,

Her face red and white, a panic.

You have stuck her kittens outside your window

In a sort of cement well

Where they crap and puke and cry and she cant hear.

You say you cant stand her,

The bastards a girl.

You who have blown your tubes like a bad radio

Clear of voices and history, the staticky

Noise of the new.

You say I should drown the kittens. Their smell!

You say I should drown my girl.

Shell cut her throat at ten if shes mad at two.

The baby smiles, fat snail,

From the polished lozenges of orange linoleum.

You could eat him. Hes a boy.

You say your husband is just no good to you,

His Jew-mama guards his sweet sex like a pearl.

You have one baby, I have two.

I should sit on a rock off Cornwall and comb my hair.

I should wear tiger pants, I should have an affair.

We should meet in another life, we should meet in air,

Me and you.

Meanwhile theres a stink of fat and baby crap.

Im doped and thick from my last sleeping pill.

The smog of cooking, the smog of hell

Floats our heads, two venomous opposites,

Our bones, our hair.

I call you Orphan, orphan. You are ill.

The sun gives you ulcers, the wind gives you t.b.

Once you were beautiful.

In New York, Hollywood, the men said: Through?

Gee baby, you are rare.

You acted, acted, acted for the thrill.

The impotent husband slumps out for a coffee.

I try to keep him in,

An old pole for the lightning,

The acid baths, the skyfuls off of you.

He lumps it down the plastic cobbled hill,

Flogged trolley. The sparks are blue.

The blue sparks spill,

Splitting like quartz into a million bits.





O jewel. O valuable.

That night the moon

Dragged its blood bag, sick

Animal

Up over the harbor lights.

And then grew normal,

Hard and apart and white.

The scale-sheen on the sand scared me to death.

We kept picking up handfuls, loving it,

Working it like dough, a mulatto body,

The silk grits.

A dog picked up your doggy husband. They went on.





Now I am silent, hate

Up to my neck,



Thick, thick.

I do not speak.

I am packing the hard potatoes like good clothes,

I am packing the babies,

I am packing the sick cats.

O vase of acid,

It is love you are full of. You know who you hate.

He is hugging his ball and chain down by the gate

That opens to the sea

Where it drives in, white and black,

Then spews it back.

Every day you fill him with soul-stuff, like a pitcher.

You are so exhausted.

Your voice my ear-ring,

Flapping and sucking, blood-loving bat.

That is that. That is that.

You peer from the door,

Sad hag. Every womans a whore.

I cant communicate.





I see your cute dcor

Close on you like the fist of a baby

Or an anemone, that sea

Sweetheart, that kleptomaniac.

I am still raw.

I say I may be back.

You know what lies are for.





Even in your Zen heaven we shant meet.





The Other





You come in late, wiping your lips.

What did I leave untouched on the doorstep





White Nike,

Streaming between my walls?





Smilingly, blue lightning

Assumes, like a meathook, the burden of his parts.





The police love you, you confess everything.

Bright hair, shoe-black, old plastic,





Is my life so intriguing?

Is it for this you widen your eye-rings?





Is it for this the air motes depart?

They are not air motes, they are corpuscles.





Open your handbag. What is that bad smell?

It is your knitting, busily





Hooking itself to itself,

It is your sticky candies.





I have your head on my wall.

Navel cords, blue-red and lucent,





Shriek from my belly like arrows, and these I ride.

O moon-glow, o sick one,





The stolen horses, the fornications

Circle a womb of marble.





Where are you going

That you suck breath like mileage?





Sulfurous adulteries grieve in a dream.

Cold glass, how you insert yourself





Between myself and myself.

I scratch like a cat.





The blood that runs is dark fruit

An effect, a cosmetic.





You smile.

No, it is not fatal.





Stopped Dead





A squeal of brakes.

Or is it a birth cry?

And here we are, hung out over the dead drop

Uncle, pants factory Fatso, millionaire.

And you out cold beside me in your chair.





The wheels, two rubber grubs, bite their sweet tails.

Is that Spain down there?

Red and yellow, two passionate hot metals

Writhing and sighing, what sort of a scenery is it?

It isn’t England, it isn’t France, it isn’t Ireland.





It’s violent. We’re here on a visit,

With a goddam baby screaming off somewhere.

There’s always a bloody baby in the air.

I’d call it a sunset, but

Whoever heard a sunset yowl like that?





You are sunk in your seven chins, still as a ham.

Who do you think I am,

Uncle, uncle?

Sad Hamlet, with a knife?

Where do you stash your life?





Is it a penny, a pearl——

Your soul, your soul?

I’ll carry it off like a rich pretty girl,

Simply open the door and step out of the car

And live in Gibraltar on air, on air.





Poppies in October




for Helder and Suzette Macedo





Even the sun-clouds this morning cannot manage such skirts.

Nor the woman in the ambulance

Whose red heart blooms through her coat so astoundingly





A gift, a love gift

Utterly unasked for

By a sky





Palely and flamily

Igniting its carbon monoxides, by eyes

Dulled to a halt under bowlers.





O my God, what am I

That these late mouths should cry open

In a forest of frost, in a dawn of cornflowers!





The Courage of Shutting-Up





The courage of the shut mouth, in spite of artillery!

The line pink and quiet, a worm, basking.

There are black discs behind it, the discs of outrage,

And the outrage of a sky, the lined brain of it.

The discs revolve, they ask to be heard,





Loaded, as they are, with accounts of bastardies.

Bastardies, usages, desertions and doubleness,

The needle journeying in its groove,

Silver beast between two dark canyons,

A great surgeon, now a tattooist,





Tattooing over and over the same blue grievances,

The snakes, the babies, the tits

On mermaids and two-legged dreamgirls.

The surgeon is quiet, he does not speak.

He has seen too much death, his hands are full of it.





So the discs of the brain revolve, like the muzzles of cannon.

Then there is that antique billhook, the tongue,

Indefatigable, purple. Must it be cut out?

It has nine tails, it is dangerous.

And the noise it flays from the air, once it gets going.





No, the tongue, too, has been put by

Hung up in the library with the engravings of Rangoon

And the fox heads, the otter heads, the heads of dead rabbits.

It is a marvellous object

The things it has pierced in its time!





But how about the eyes, the eyes, the eyes?

Mirrors can kill and talk, they are terrible rooms

In which a torture goes on one can only watch.

The face that lived in this mirror is the face of a dead man.

Do not worry about the eyes





They may be white and shy, they are no stool pigeons,

Their death rays folded like flags

Of a country no longer heard of,

An obstinate independency

Insolvent among the mountains.





Nick and the Candlestick





I am a miner. The light burns blue.

Waxy stalacmites

Drip and thicken, tears





The earthen womb

Exudes from its dead boredom.

Black bat airs





Wrap me, raggy shawls,

Cold homicides.

They weld to me like plums.





Old cave of calcium

Icicles, old echoer.

Even the newts are white,





Those holy Joes.

And the fish, the fish

Christ! they are panes of ice,





A vice of knives,

A piranha

Religion, drinking





Its first communion out of my live toes.

The candle

Gulps and recovers its small altitude,





Its yellows hearten.

O love, how did you get here?

O embryo





Remembering, even in sleep,

Your crossed position.

The blood blooms clean





In you, ruby.

The pain

You wake to is not yours.





Love, love,

I have hung our cave with roses,

With soft rugs





The last of Victoriana.

Let the stars

Plummet to their dark address,





Let the mercuric

Atoms that cripple drip

Into the terrible well,





You are the one

Solid the spaces lean on, envious.

You are the baby in the barn.





Berck-Plage





(1)




This is the sea, then, this great abeyance.

How the sun’s poultice draws on my inflammation!





Electrifyingly-colored sherbets, scooped from the freeze

By pale girls, travel the air in scorched hands.





Why is it so quiet, what are they hiding?

I have two legs, and I move smilingly.





A sandy damper kills the vibrations;

It stretches for miles, the shrunk voices





Waving and crutchless, half their old size.

The lines of the eye, scalded by these bald surfaces,





Boomerang like anchored elastics, hurting the owner.

Is it any wonder he puts on dark glasses?





Is it any wonder he affects a black cassock?

Here he comes now, among the mackerel gatherers





Who wall up their backs against him.

They are handling the black and green lozenges like the parts

of a body.





The sea, that crystallized these,

Creeps away, many-snaked, with a long hiss of distress.





(2)




This black boot has no mercy for anybody.

Why should it, it is the hearse of a dead foot,





The high, dead, toeless foot of this priest

Who plumbs the well of his book,





The bent print bulging before him like scenery.

Obscene bikinis hide in the dunes,





Breasts and hips a confectioner’s sugar

Of little crystals, titillating the light,





While a green pool opens its eye,

Sick with what it has swallowed——





Limbs, images, shrieks. Behind the concrete bunkers

Two lovers unstick themselves.





O white sea-crockery,

What cupped sighs, what salt in the throat!





And the onlooker, trembling,

Drawn like a long material





Through a still virulence,

And a weed, hairy as privates.





(3)




On the balconies of the hotel, things are glittering.

Things, things——





Tubular steel wheelchairs, aluminum crutches.

Such salt-sweetness. Why should I walk





Beyond the breakwater, spotty with barnacles?

I am not a nurse, white and attendant,





I am not a smile.

These children are after something, with hooks and cries,





And my heart too small to bandage their terrible faults.

This is the side of a man: his red ribs,





The nerves bursting like trees, and this is the surgeon:

One mirrory eye——





A facet of knowledge.

On a striped mattress in one room





An old man is vanishing.

There is no help in his weeping wife.





Where are the eye-stones, yellow and valuable,

And the tongue, sapphire of ash.





(4)




A wedding-cake face in a paper frill.

How superior he is now.





It is like possessing a saint.

The nurses in their wing-caps are no longer so beautiful;





They are browning, like touched gardenias.

The bed is rolled from the wall.





This is what it is to be complete. It is horrible.

Is he wearing pajamas or an evening suit





Under the glued sheet from which his powdery beak

Rises so whitely, unbuffeted?





They propped his jaw with a book until it stiffened

And folded his hands, that were shaking: goodbye, goodbye.





Now the washed sheets fly in the sun,

The pillow cases are sweetening.





It is a blessing, it is a blessing:

The long coffin of soap-colored oak,





The curious bearers and the raw date

Engraving itself in silver with marvelous calm.





(5)




The grey sky lowers, the hills like a green sea

Run fold upon fold far off, concealing their hollows,





The hollows in which rock the thoughts of the wife——

Blunt, practical boats





Full of dresses and hats and china and married daughters.

In the parlor of the stone house





One curtain is flickering from the open window,

Flickering and pouring, a pitiful candle.





This is the tongue of the dead man: remember, remember.

How far he is now, his actions





Around him like livingroom furniture, like a décor.

As the pallors gather——





The pallors of hands and neighborly faces,

The elate pallors of flying iris.





They are flying off into nothing: remember us.

The empty benches of memory look over stones,





Marble façades with blue veins, and jelly-glassfuls of daffodils.

It is so beautiful up here: it is a stopping place.





(6)




The unnatural fatness of these lime leaves!——

Pollarded green balls, the trees march to church.





The voice of the priest, in thin air,

Meets the corpse at the gate,





Addressing it, while the hills roll the notes of the dead bell;

A glitter of wheat and crude earth.





What is the name of that color?——

Old blood of caked walls the sun heals,





Old blood of limb stumps, burnt hearts.

The widow with her black pocketbook and three daughters,





Necessary among the flowers,

Enfolds her face like fine linen,





Not to be spread again.

While a sky, wormy with put-by smiles,





Passes cloud after cloud.

And the bride flowers expend a freshness,





And the soul is a bride

In a still place, and the groom is red and forgetful, he is featureless.





(7)




Behind the glass of this car

The world purrs, shut-off and gentle.





And I am dark-suited and still, a member of the party,

Gliding up in low gear behind the cart.





And the priest is a vessel,

A tarred fabric, sorry and dull,





Following the coffin on its flowery cart like a beautiful woman,

A crest of breasts, eyelids and lips





Storming the hilltop.

Then, from the barred yard, the children





Smell the melt of shoe-blacking,

Their faces turning, wordless and slow,





Their eyes opening

On a wonderful thing——





Six round black hats in the grass and a lozenge of wood,

And a naked mouth, red and awkward.





For a minute the sky pours into the hole like plasma.

There is no hope, it is given up.





Gulliver





Over your body the clouds go

High, high and icily

And a little flat, as if they





Floated on a glass that was invisible.

Unlike swans,

Having no reflections;





Unlike you,

With no strings attached.

All cool, all blue. Unlike you





You, there on your back,

Eyes to the sky.

The spider-men have caught you,





Winding and twining their petty fetters,

Their bribes

So many silks.





How they hate you.

They converse in the valley of your fingers, they are inchworms.

They would have you sleep in their cabinets,





This toe and that toe, a relic.

Step off!

Step off seven leagues, like those distances





That revolve in Crivelli, untouchable.

Let this eye be an eagle,

The shadow of his lip, an abyss.





Getting There





How far is it?

How far is it now?

The gigantic gorilla interior

Of the wheels move, they appal me

The terrible brains

Of Krupp, black muzzles

Revolving, the sound

Punching out Absence! like cannon.

It is Russia I have to get across, it is some war or other.

I am dragging my body

Quietly through the straw of the boxcars.

Now is the time for bribery.

What do wheels eat, these wheels

Fixed to their arcs like gods,

The silver leash of the will

Inexorable. And their pride!

All the gods know is destinations.

I am a letter in this slot

I fly to a name, two eyes.

Will there be fire, will there be bread?

Here there is such mud.

It is a trainstop, the nurses

Undergoing the faucet water, its veils, veils in a nunnery,

Touching their wounded,

The men the blood still pumps forward,

Legs, arms piled outside

The tent of unending cries

A hospital of dolls.

And the men, what is left of the men

Pumped ahead by these pistons, this blood

Into the next mile,



The next hour

Dynasty of broken arrows!





How far is it?

There is mud on my feet,

Thick, red and slipping. It is Adams side,

This earth I rise from, and I in agony.

I cannot undo myself, and the train is steaming.

Steaming and breathing, its teeth

Ready to roll, like a devils.

There is a minute at the end of it

A minute, a dewdrop.

How far is it?

It is so small

The place I am getting to, why are there these obstacles

The body of this woman,

Charred skirts and deathmask

Mourned by religious figures, by garlanded children.

And now detonations

Thunder and guns.

The fires between us.

Is there no still place

Turning and turning in the middle air,

Untouched and untouchable.

The train is dragging itself, it is screaming

An animal

Insane for the destination,

The bloodspot,

The face at the end of the flare.

I shall bury the wounded like pupas,

I shall count and bury the dead.

Let their souls writhe in a dew,

Incense in my track.

The carriages rock, they are cradles.



And I, stepping from this skin

Of old bandages, boredoms, old faces





Step to you from the black car of Lethe,

Pure as a baby.





Medusa





Off that landspit of stony mouth-plugs,

Eyes rolled by white sticks,

Ears cupping the seas incoherences,

You house your unnerving headGod-ball,

Lens of mercies,





Your stooges

Plying their wild cells in my keels shadow,

Pushing by like hearts,

Red stigmata at the very center,

Riding the rip tide to the nearest point of departure,





Dragging their Jesus hair.

Did I escape, I wonder?

My mind winds to you,

Old barnacled umbilicus, Atlantic cable,

Keeping itself, it seems, in a state of miraculous repair.





In any case, you are always there,

Tremulous breath at the end of my line,

Curve of water upleaping

To my water rod, dazzling and grateful,

Touching and sucking.





I didnt call you.

I didnt call you at all.

Nevertheless, nevertheless

You steamed to me over the sea,

Fat and red, a placenta





Paralyzing the kicking lovers.

Cobra light

Squeezing the breath from the blood bells

Of the fuchsia. I could draw no breath,

Dead and moneyless,





Overexposed, like an X ray.

Who do you think you are?

A Communion wafer? Blubbery Mary?

I shall take no bite of your body,

Bottle in which I live,





Ghastly Vatican.

I am sick to death of hot salt.

Green as eunuchs, your wishes

Hiss at my sins.

Off, off, eely tentacle!





There is nothing between us.





Purdah





Jade

Stone of the side,

The agonized





Side of green Adam, I

Smile, cross-legged,

Enigmatical,





Shifting my clarities.

So valuable.

How the sun polishes this shoulder!





And should

The moon, my

Indefatigable cousin





Rise, with her cancerous pallors,

Dragging trees

Little bushy polyps,





Little nets,

My visibilities hide.

I gleam like a mirror.





At this facet the bridegroom arrives,

Lord of the mirrors.

It is himself he guides





In among these silk

Screens, these rustling appurtenances.

I breathe, and the mouth





Veil stirs its curtain.

My eye

Veil is





A concatenation of rainbows.

I am his.

Even in his





Absence, I

Revolve in my

Sheath of impossibles,





Priceless and quiet

Among these parakeets, macaws.

O chatterers





Attendants of the eyelash!

I shall unloose

One feather, like the peacock.





Attendants of the lip!

I shall unloose

One note





Shattering

The chandelier

Of air that all day plies





Its crystals,

A million ignorants.

Attendants!





Attendants!

And at his next step

I shall unloose





I shall unloose

From the small jeweled

Doll he guards like a heart





The lioness,

The shriek in the bath,

The cloak of holes.





The Moon and the Yew Tree





This is the light of the mind, cold and planetary.

The trees of the mind are black. The light is blue.

The grasses unload their griefs on my feet as if I were God,

Prickling my ankles and murmuring of their humility.

Fumey, spiritous mists inhabit this place

Separated from my house by a row of headstones.

I simply cannot see where there is to get to.





The moon is no door. It is a face in its own right,

White as a knuckle and terribly upset.

It drags the sea after it like a dark crime; it is quiet

With the O-gape of complete despair. I live here.

Twice on Sunday, the bells startle the sky

Eight great tongues affirming the Resurrection.

At the end, they soberly bong out their names.





The yew tree points up. It has a Gothic shape.

The eyes lift after it and find the moon.

The moon is my mother. She is not sweet like Mary.

Her blue garments unloose small bats and owls.

How I would like to believe in tenderness

The face of the effigy, gentled by candles,

Bending, on me in particular, its mild eyes.





I have fallen a long way. Clouds are flowering

Blue and mystical over the face of the stars.

Inside the church, the saints will be all blue,

Floating on their delicate feet over the cold pews,

Their hands and faces stiff with holiness.

The moon sees nothing of this. She is bald and wild.

And the message of the yew tree is blacknessblackness and silence.





A Birthday Present





What is this, behind this veil, is it ugly, is it beautiful?

It is shimmering, has it breasts, has it edges?





I am sure it is unique, I am sure it is just what I want.

When I am quiet at my cooking I feel it looking, I feel it thinking





‘Is this the one I am to appear for,

Is this the elect one, the one with black eye-pits and a scar?





Measuring the flour, cutting off the surplus,

Adhering to rules, to rules, to rules.





Is this the one for the annunciation?

My god, what a laugh!’





But it shimmers, it does not stop, and I think it wants me.

I would not mind if it was bones, or a pearl button.





I do not want much of a present, anyway, this year.

After all, I am alive only by accident.





I would have killed myself gladly that time any possible way.

Now there are these veils, shimmering like curtains,





The diaphanous satins of a January window

White as babies’ bedding and glittering with dead breath. O ivory!





It must be a tusk there, a ghost-column.

Can you not see I do not mind what it is.





Can you not give it to me?

Do not be ashamed—I do not mind if it is small.





Do not be mean, I am ready for enormity.

Let us sit down to it, one on either side, admiring the gleam,





The glaze, the mirrory variety of it.

Let us eat our last supper at it, like a hospital plate.





I know why you will not give it to me,

You are terrified





The world will go up in a shriek, and your head with it,

Bossed, brazen, an antique shield,





A marvel to your great-grandchildren.

Do not be afraid, it is not so.





I will only take it and go aside quietly.

You will not even hear me opening it, no paper crackle,





No falling ribbons, no scream at the end.

I do not think you credit me with this discretion.





If you only knew how the veils were killing my days.

To you they are only transparencies, clear air.





But my god, the clouds are like cotton——

Armies of them. They are carbon monoxide.





Sweetly, sweetly I breathe in,

Filling my veins with invisibles, with the million





Probable motes that tick the years off my life.

You are silver-suited for the occasion. O adding machine——





Is it impossible for you to let something go and have it go whole?

Must you stamp each piece in purple,





Must you kill what you can?

There is this one thing I want today, and only you can give it to me.





It stands at my window, big as the sky.

It breathes from my sheets, the cold, dead center





Where spilt lives congeal and stiffen to history.

Let it not come by the mail, finger by finger.





Let it not come by word of mouth, I should be sixty

By the time the whole of it was delivered, and too numb to use it.





Only let down the veil, the veil, the veil.

If it were death





I would admire the deep gravity of it, its timeless eyes.

I would know you were serious.





There would be a nobility then, there would be a birthday.

And the knife not carve, but enter





Pure and clean as the cry of a baby,

And the universe slide from my side.





Letter in November





Love, the world

Suddenly turns, turns color. The streetlight

Splits through the rats-tail

Pods of the laburnum at nine in the morning.

It is the Arctic,





This little black

Circle, with its tawn silk grassesbabies hair.

There is a green in the air,

Soft, delectable.

It cushions me lovingly.





I am flushed and warm.

I think I may be enormous,

I am so stupidly happy,

My Wellingtons

Squelching and squelching through the beautiful red.





This is my property.

Two times a day

I pace it, sniffing

The barbarous holly with its viridian

Scallops, pure iron,





And the wall of old corpses.

I love them.

I love them like history.

The apples are golden,

Imagine it





My seventy trees

Holding their gold-ruddy balls

In a thick grey death-soup,

Their million

Gold leaves metal and breathless.





O love, O celibate.

Nobody but me

Walks the waist-high wet.

The irreplaceable

Golds bleed and deepen, the mouths of Thermopylae.





Amnesiac





No use, no use, now, begging Recognize.

There is nothing to do with such a beautiful blank but smooth it.

Name, house, car keys,





The little toy wife

Erased, sigh, sigh.

Four babies and a cocker.





Nurses the size of worms and a minute doctor

Tuck him in.

Old happenings





Peel from his skin.

Down the drain with all of it!

Hugging his pillow





Like the red-headed sister he never dared to touch,

He dreams of a new one

Barren, the lot are barren.





And of another color.

How theyll travel, travel, travel, scenery

Sparking off their brother-sister rears,





A comet tail.

And money the sperm fluid of it all.

One nurse brings in





A green drink, one a blue.

They rise on either side of him like stars.

The two drinks flame and foam.





O sister, mother, wife,

Sweet Lethe is my life.

I am never, never, never coming home!





The Rival





If the moon smiled, she would resemble you.

You leave the same impression

Of something beautiful, but annihilating.

Both of you are great light borrowers.

Her O-mouth grieves at the world; yours is unaffected,





And your first gift is making stone out of everything.

I wake to a mausoleum; you are here,

Ticking your fingers on the marble table, looking for cigarettes,

Spiteful as a woman, but not so nervous,

And dying to say something unanswerable.





The moon, too, abases her subjects,

But in the daytime she is ridiculous.

Your dissatisfactions, on the other hand,

Arrive through the mailslot with loving regularity,

White and blank, expansive as carbon monoxide.





No day is safe from news of you,

Walking about in Africa maybe, but thinking of me.





Daddy





You do not do, you do not do

Any more, black shoe

In which I have lived like a foot

For thirty years, poor and white,

Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.





Daddy, I have had to kill you.

You died before I had time

Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,

Ghastly statue with one grey toe

Big as a Frisco seal





And a head in the freakish Atlantic

Where it pours bean green over blue

In the waters off beautiful Nauset.

I used to pray to recover you.

Ach, du.





In the German tongue, in the Polish town

Scraped flat by the roller

Of wars, wars, wars.

But the name of the town is common.

My Polack friend





Says there are a dozen or two.

So I never could tell where you

Put your foot, your root,

I never could talk to you.

The tongue stuck in my jaw.





It stuck in a barb wire snare.

Ich, ich, ich, ich.

I could hardly speak.

I thought every German was you.

And the language obscene





An engine, an engine

Chuffing me off like a Jew.

A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.

I began to talk like a Jew.

I think I may well be a Jew.





The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna

Are not very pure or true.

With my gypsy ancestress and my weird luck

And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack

I may be a bit of a Jew.





I have always been scared of you,

With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.

And your neat moustache

And your Aryan eye, bright blue.

Panzer-man, panzer-man, o You





Not God but a swastika

So black no sky could squeak through.

Every woman adores a Fascist,

The boot in the face, the brute

Brute heart of a brute like you.





You stand at the blackboard, daddy,

In the picture I have of you,

A cleft in your chin instead of your foot

But no less a devil for that, no not

Any less the black man who





Bit my pretty red heart in two.

I was ten when they buried you.

At twenty I tried to die

And get back, back, back to you.

I thought even the bones would do





But they pulled me out of the sack,

And they stuck me together with glue.

And then I knew what to do.

I made a model of you,

A man in black with a Meinkampf look





And a love of the rack and the screw.

And I said I do, I do.

So daddy, Im finally through.

The black telephones off at the root,

The voices just cant worm through.





If Ive killed one man, Ive killed two

The vampire who said he was you

And drank my blood for a year,

Seven years, if you want to know.

Daddy, you can lie back now.





Theres a stake in your fat black heart

And the villagers never liked you.

They are dancing and stamping on you.

They always knew it was you.

Daddy, daddy, you bastard, Im through.





You're





Clownlike, happiest on your hands,

Feet to the stars, and moon-skulled,

Gilled like a fish. A common-sense

Thumbs-down on the dodo’s mode.

Wrapped up in yourself like a spool,

Trawling your dark as owls do.

Mute as a turnip from the Fourth

Of July to All Fools’ Day,

O high-riser, my little loaf.





Vague as fog and looked for like mail.

Farther off than Australia.

Bent-backed Atlas, our traveled prawn.

Snug as a bud and at home

Like a sprat in a pickle jug.

A creel of eels, all ripples.

Jumpy as a Mexican bean.

Right, like a well-done sum.

A clean slate, with your own face on.





Fever 103°





Pure? What does it mean?

The tongues of hell

Are dull, dull as the triple





Tongues of dull, fat Cerberus

Who wheezes at the gate. Incapable

Of licking clean





The aguey tendon, the sin, the sin.

The tinder cries.

The indelible smell





Of a snuffed candle!

Love, love, the low smokes roll

From me like Isadora’s scarves, I’m in a fright





One scarf will catch and anchor in the wheel.

Such yellow sullen smokes

Make their own element. They will not rise,





But trundle round the globe

Choking the aged and the meek,

The weak





Hothouse baby in its crib,

The ghastly orchid

Hanging its hanging garden in the air,





Devilish leopard!

Radiation turned it white

And killed it in an hour.





Greasing the bodies of adulterers

Like Hiroshima ash and eating in.

The sin. The sin.





Darling, all night

I have been flickering, off, on, off, on.

The sheets grow heavy as a lecher’s kiss.





Three days. Three nights.

Lemon water, chicken

Water, water make me retch.





I am too pure for you or anyone.

Your body

Hurts me as the world hurts God. I am a lantern——





My head a moon

Of Japanese paper, my gold beaten skin

Infinitely delicate and infinitely expensive.





Does not my heat astound you. And my light.

All by myself I am a huge camellia

Glowing and coming and going, flush on flush.





I think I am going up,

I think I may rise——

The beads of hot metal fly, and I, love, I





Am a pure acetylene

Virgin

Attended by roses,





By kisses, by cherubim,

By whatever these pink things mean.

Not you, nor him





Nor him, nor him

(My selves dissolving, old whore petticoats)——

To Paradise.





The Bee Meeting





Who are these people at the bridge to meet me? They are the villagers——

The rector, the midwife, the sexton, the agent for bees.

In my sleeveless summery dress I have no protection,

And they are all gloved and covered, why did nobody tell me?

They are smiling and taking out veils tacked to ancient hats.





I am nude as a chicken neck, does nobody love me?

Yes, here is the secretary of bees with her white shop smock,

Buttoning the cuffs at my wrists and the slit from my neck to my knees.

Now I am milkweed silk, the bees will not notice.

They will not smell my fear, my fear, my fear.





Which is the rector now, is it that man in black?

Which is the midwife, is that her blue coat?

Everybody is nodding a square black head, they are knights in visors,

Breastplates of cheesecloth knotted under the armpits.

Their smiles and their voices are changing. I am led through a beanfield,





Strips of tinfoil winking like people,

Feather dusters fanning their hands in a sea of bean flowers,

Creamy bean flowers with black eyes and leaves like bored hearts.

Is it blood clots the tendrils are dragging up that string?

No, no, it is scarlet flowers that will one day be edible.





Now they are giving me a fashionable white straw Italian hat

And a black veil that molds to my face, they are making me one of them.

They are leading me to the shorn grove, the circle of hives.

Is it the hawthorn that smells so sick?

The barren body of hawthorn, etherizing its children.





Is it some operation that is taking place?

It is the surgeon my neighbors are waiting for,

This apparition in a green helmet,

Shining gloves and white suit.

Is it the butcher, the grocer, the postman, someone I know?





I cannot run, I am rooted, and the gorse hurts me

With its yellow purses, its spiky armory.

I could not run without having to run forever.

The white hive is snug as a virgin,

Sealing off her brood cells, her honey, and quietly humming.





Smoke rolls and scarves in the grove.

The mind of the hive thinks this is the end of everything.

Here they come, the outriders, on their hysterical elastics.

If I stand very still, they will think I am cow parsley,

A gullible head untouched by their animosity,





Not even nodding, a personage in a hedgerow.

The villagers open the chambers, they are hunting the queen.

Is she hiding, is she eating honey? She is very clever.

She is old, old, old, she must live another year, and she knows it.

While in their fingerjoint cells the new virgins





Dream of a duel they will win inevitably,

A curtain of wax dividing them from the bride flight,

The upflight of the murderess into a heaven that loves her.

The villagers are moving the virgins, there will be no killing.

The old queen does not show herself, is she so ungrateful?





I am exhausted, I am exhausted——

Pillar of white in a blackout of knives.

I am the magician’s girl who does not flinch.

The villagers are untying their disguises, they are shaking hands.

Whose is that long white box in the grove, what have they accomplished, why am I cold.





The Arrival of the Bee Box





I ordered this, this clean wood box

Square as a chair and almost too heavy to lift.

I would say it was the coffin of a midget

Or a square baby

Were there not such a din in it.





The box is locked, it is dangerous.

I have to live with it overnight

And I cant keep away from it.

There are no windows, so I cant see what is in there.

There is only a little grid, no exit.





I put my eye to the grid.

It is dark, dark,

With the swarmy feeling of African hands

Minute and shrunk for export,

Black on black, angrily clambering.





How can I let them out?

It is the noise that appals me most of all,

The unintelligible syllables.

It is like a Roman mob,

Small, taken one by one, but my god, together!





I lay my ear to furious Latin.

I am not a Caesar.

I have simply ordered a box of maniacs.

They can be sent back.

They can die, I need feed them nothing, I am the owner.





I wonder how hungry they are.

I wonder if they would forget me

If I just undid the locks and stood back and turned into a tree.

There is the laburnum, its blond colonnades,

And the petticoats of the cherry.





They might ignore me immediately

In my moon suit and funeral veil.

I am no source of honey

So why should they turn on me?

Tomorrow I will be sweet God, I will set them free.





The box is only temporary.





Stings





Bare-handed, I hand the combs.

The man in white smiles, bare-handed,

Our cheesecloth gauntlets neat and sweet,

The throats of our wrists brave lilies.

He and I





Have a thousand clean cells between us,

Eight combs of yellow cups,

And the hive itself a teacup,

White with pink flowers on it.

With excessive love I enameled it





Thinking Sweetness, sweetness.

Brood cells grey as the fossils of shells

Terrify me, they seem so old.

What am I buying, wormy mahogany?

Is there any queen at all in it?





If there is, she is old,

Her wings torn shawls, her long body

Rubbed of its plush

Poor and bare and unqueenly and even shameful.

I stand in a column





Of winged, unmiraculous women,

Honey-drudgers.

I am no drudge

Though for years I have eaten dust

And dried plates with my dense hair.





And seen my strangeness evaporate,

Blue dew from dangerous skin.

Will they hate me,

These women who only scurry,

Whose news is the open cherry, the open clover?





It is almost over.

I am in control.

Here is my honey-machine,

It will work without thinking,

Opening, in spring, like an industrious virgin





To scour the creaming crests

As the moon, for its ivory powders, scours the sea.

A third person is watching.

He has nothing to do with the bee-seller or with me.

Now he is gone





In eight great bounds, a great scapegoat.

Here is his slipper, here is another,

And here the square of white linen

He wore instead of a hat.

He was sweet,





The sweat of his efforts a rain

Tugging the world to fruit.

The bees found him out,

Molding onto his lips like lies,

Complicating his features.





They thought death was worth it, but I

Have a self to recover, a queen.

Is she dead, is she sleeping?

Where has she been,

With her lion-red body, her wings of glass?





Now she is flying

More terrible than she ever was, red

Scar in the sky, red comet

Over the engine that killed her

The mausoleum, the wax house.





Wintering





This is the easy time, there is nothing doing.

I have whirled the midwifes extractor,

I have my honey,

Six jars of it,

Six cats eyes in the wine cellar,





Wintering in a dark without window

At the heart of the house

Next to the last tenants rancid jam

And the bottles of empty glitters

Sir So-and-sos gin.





This is the room I have never been in.

This is the room I could never breathe in.

The black bunched in there like a bat,

No light

But the torch and its faint





Chinese yellow on appalling objects

Black asininity. Decay.

Possession.

It is they who own me.

Neither cruel nor indifferent,





Only ignorant.

This is the time of hanging on for the beesthe bees

So slow I hardly know them,

Filing like soldiers

To the syrup tin





To make up for the honey Ive taken.

Tate and Lyle keeps them going,

The refined snow.

It is Tate and Lyle they live on, instead of flowers.

They take it. The cold sets in.





Now they ball in a mass,

Black

Mind against all that white.

The smile of the snow is white.

It spreads itself out, a mile-long body of Meissen,





Into which, on warm days,

They can only carry their dead.

The bees are all women,

Maids and the long royal lady.

They have got rid of the men,





The blunt, clumsy stumblers, the boors.

Winter is for women

The woman, still at her knitting,

At the cradle of Spanish walnut,

Her body a bulb in the cold and too dumb to think.





Will the hive survive, will the gladiolas

Succeed in banking their fires

To enter another year?

What will they taste of, the Christmas roses?

The bees are flying. They taste the spring.






The Swarm





Somebody is shooting at something in our town——

A dull pom, pom in the Sunday street.

Jealousy can open the blood,

It can make black roses.

What are they shooting at?





It is you the knives are out for

At Waterloo, Waterloo, Napoleon,

The hump of Elba on your short back,

And the snow, marshalling its brilliant cutlery

Mass after mass, saying Shh,





Shh. These are chess people you play with,

Still figures of ivory.

The mud squirms with throats,

Stepping stones for French bootsoles.

The gilt and pink domes of Russia melt and float off





In the furnace of greed. Clouds! Clouds!

So the swarm balls and deserts

Seventy feet up, in a black pine tree.

It must be shot down. Pom! Pom!

So dumb it thinks bullets are thunder.





It thinks they are the voice of God

Condoning the beak, the claw, the grin of the dog

Yellow-haunched, a pack dog,

Grinning over its bone of ivory

Like the pack, the pack, like everybody.





The bees have got so far. Seventy feet high.

Russia, Poland and Germany.



The mild hills, the same old magenta

Fields shrunk to a penny

Spun into a river, the river crossed.





The bees argue, in their black ball,

A flying hedgehog, all prickles.

The man with grey hands stands under the honeycomb

Of their dream, the hived station

Where trains, faithful to their steel arcs,





Leave and arrive, and there is no end to the country.

Pom, pom. They fall

Dismembered, to a tod of ivy.

So much for the chariots, the outriders, the Grand Army.

A red tatter, Napoleon.





The last badge of victory.

The swarm is knocked into a cocked straw hat.

Elba, Elba, bleb on the sea.

The white busts of marshals, admirals, generals

Worming themselves into niches.





How instructive this is!

The dumb, banded bodies

Walking the plank draped with Mother France’s upholstery

Into a new mausoleum,

An ivory palace, a crotch pine.





The man with grey hands smiles——

The smile of a man of business, intensely practical.

They are not hands at all

But asbestos receptacles.

Pom, pom! ‘They would have killed me.’





Stings big as drawing pins!

It seems bees have a notion of honor,

A black, intractable mind.

Napoleon is pleased, he is pleased with everything.

O Europe. O ton of honey.





The Colossus & Other Poems


The Manor Garden





The fountains are dry and the roses over.

Incense of death. Your day approaches.

The pears fatten like little buddhas.

A blue mist is dragging the lake.





You move through the era of fishes,

The smug centuries of the pig—

Head, toe and finger

Come clear of the shadow. History





Nourishes these broken flutings,

These crowns of acanthus,

And the crow settles her garments.

You inherit white heather, a bee’s wing,





Two suicides, the family wolves,

Hours of blankness. Some hard stars

Already yellow the heavens.

The spider on its own string





Crosses the lake. The worms

Quit their usual habitations.

The small birds converge, converge

With their gifts to a difficult borning.





Two Views of a Cadaver Room





1


The day she visited the dissecting room

They had four men laid out, black as burnt turkey,

Already half unstrung. A vinegary fume

Of the death vats clung to them;

The white-smocked boys started working.

The head of his cadaver had caved in,

And she could scarcely make out anything

In that rubble of skull plates and old leather.

A sallow piece of string held it together.





In their jars the snail-nosed babies moon and glow.

He hands her the cut-out heart like a cracked heirloom.





2


In Brueghel’s panorama of smoke and slaughter

Two people only are blind to the carrion army:

He, afloat in the sea of her blue satin

Skirts, sings in the direction

Of her bare shoulder, while she bends,

Fingering a leaflet of music, over him,

Both of them deaf to the fiddle in the hands

Of the death’s-head shadowing their song.

These Flemish lovers flourish; not for long.





Yet desolation, stalled in paint, spares the little country

Foolish, delicate, in the lower right-hand corner.





Night Shift





It was not a heart, beating,

That muted boom, that clangor

Far off, not blood in the ears

Drumming up any fever





To impose on the evening.

The noise came from the outside:

A metal detonating

Native, evidently, to





These stilled suburbs: nobody

Startled at it, though the sound

Shook the ground with its pounding.

It took root at my coming





Till the thudding source, exposed,

Confounded inept guesswork:

Framed in windows of Main Street’s

Silver factory, immense





Hammers hoisted, wheels turning,

Stalled, let fall their vertical

Tonnage of metal and wood;

Stunned the marrow. Men in white





Undershirts circled, tending

Without stop those greased machines,

Tending, without stop, the blunt

Indefatigable fact.





Sow





God knows how our neighbor managed to breed

His great sow:

Whatever his shrewd secret, he kept it hid





In the same way

He kept the sow—impounded from public stare,

Prize ribbon and pig show.





But one dusk our questions commended us to a tour

Through his lantern-lit

Maze of barns to the lintel of the sunk sty door





To gape at it:

This was no rose-and-larkspurred china suckling

With a penny slot





For thrifty children, nor dolt pig ripe for heckling,

About to be

Glorified for prime flesh and golden crackling





In a parsley halo;

Nor even one of the common barnyard sows,

Mire-smirched, blowzy,





Maunching thistle and knotweed on her snout-cruise—

Bloat tun of milk

On the move, hedged by a litter of feat-foot ninnies





Shrilling her hulk

To halt for a swig at the pink teats. No. This vast

Brobdingnag bulk





Of a sow lounged belly-bedded on that black compost,

Fat-rutted eyes

Dream-filmed. What a vision of ancient hoghood must





Thus wholly engross

The great grandam!—our marvel blazoned a knight,

Helmed, in cuirass,





Unhorsed and shredded in the grove of combat

By a grisly-bristled

Boar, fabulous enough to straddle that sow’s heat.





But our farmer whistled,

Then, with a jocular fist thwacked the barrel nape,

And the green-copse-castled





Pig hove, letting legend like dried mud drop,

Slowly, grunt

On grunt, up in the flickering light to shape





A monument

Prodigious in gluttonies as that hog whose want

Made lean Lent





Of kitchen slops and, stomaching no constraint,

Proceeded to swill

The seven troughed seas and every earthquaking continent.





The Eye-mote





Blameless as daylight I stood looking

At a field of horses, necks bent, manes blown,

Tails streaming against the green

Backdrop of sycamores. Sun was striking

White chapel pinnacles over the roofs,

Holding the horses, the clouds, the leaves





Steadily rooted though they were all flowing

Away to the left like reeds in a sea

When the splinter flew in and stuck my eye,

Needling it dark. Then I was seeing

A melding of shapes in a hot rain:

Horses warped on the altering green,





Outlandish as double-humped camels or unicorns,

Grazing at the margins of a bad monochrome,

Beasts of oasis, a better time.

Abrading my lid, the small grain burns:

Red cinder around which I myself,

Horses, planets and spires revolve.





Neither tears nor the easing flush

Of eyebaths can unseat the speck:

It sticks, and it has stuck a week.

I wear the present itch for flesh,

Blind to what will be and what was.

I dream that I am Oedipus.





What I want back is what I was

Before the bed, before the knife,

Before the brooch-pin and the salve

Fixed me in this parenthesis;

Horses fluent in the wind,

A place, a time gone out of mind.





Hardcastle Crags





Flintlike, her feet struck

Such a racket of echoes from the steely street,

Tacking in moon-blued crooks from the black

Stone-built town, that she heard the quick air ignite

Its tinder and shake





A firework of echoes from wall

To wall of the dark, dwarfed cottages.

But the echoes died at her back as the walls

Gave way to fields and the incessant seethe of grasses

Riding in the full





Of the moon, manes to the wind,

Tireless, tied, as a moon-bound sea

Moves on its root. Though a mist-wraith wound

Up from the fissured valley and hung shoulder-high

Ahead, it fattened





To no family-featured ghost,

Nor did any word body with a name

The blank mood she walked in. Once past

The dream-peopled village, her eyes entertained no dream,

And the sandman’s dust





Lost luster under her footsoles.

The long wind, paring her person down

To a pinch of flame, blew its burdened whistle

In the whorl of her ear, and like a scooped-out pumpkin crown

Her head cupped the babel.





All the night gave her, in return

For the paltry gift of her bulk and the beat

Of her heart was the humped indifferent iron

Of its hills, and its pastures bordered by black stone set

On black stone. Barns





Guarded broods and litters

Behind shut doors; the dairy herds

Knelt in the meadow mute as boulders;

Sheep drowsed stoneward in their tussocks of wool, and birds,

Twig-sleeping, wore





Granite ruffs, their shadows

The guise of leaves. The whole landscape

Loomed absolute as the antique world was

Once, in its earliest sway of lymph and sap,

Unaltered by eyes,





Enough to snuff the quick

Of her small heat out, but before the weight

Of stones and hills of stones could break

Her down to mere quartz grit in that stony light

She turned back.





Faun





Haunched like a faun, he hooed

From grove of moon-glint and fen-frost

Until all owls in the twigged forest

Flapped black to look and brood

On the call this man made.





No sound but a drunken coot

Lurching home along river bank.

Stars hung water-sunk, so a rank

Of double star-eyes lit

Boughs where those owls sat.





An arena of yellow eyes

Watched the changing shape he cut,

Saw hoof harden from foot, saw sprout

Goat-horns. Marked how god rose

And galloped woodward in that guise.





Departure





The figs on the fig tree in the yard are green;

Green, also, the grapes on the green vine

Shading the brickred porch tiles.

The money’s run out.





How nature, sensing this, compounds her bitters.

Ungifted, ungrieved, our leavetaking.

The sun shines on unripe corn.

Cats play in the stalks.





Retrospect shall not soften such penury—

Sun’s brass, the moon’s steely patinas,

The leaden slag of the world—

But always expose





The scraggy rock spit shielding the town’s blue bay

Against which the brunt of outer sea

Beats, is brutal endlessly.

Gull-fouled, a stone hut





Bares its low lintel to corroding weathers:

Across that jut of ochreous rock

Goats shamble, morose, rank-haired,

To lick the sea-salt.





The Colossus





I shall never get you put together entirely,

Pieced, glued, and properly jointed.

Mule-bray, pig-grunt and bawdy cackles

Proceed from your great lips.

It’s worse than a barnyard.





Perhaps you consider yourself an oracle,

Mouthpiece of the dead, or of some god or other.

Thirty years now I have labored

To dredge the silt from your throat.

I am none the wiser.





Scaling little ladders with gluepots and pails of lysol

I crawl like an ant in mourning

Over the weedy acres of your brow

To mend the immense skull plates and clear

The bald, white tumuli of your eyes.





A blue sky out of the Oresteia

Arches above us. O father, all by yourself

You are pithy and historical as the Roman Forum.

I open my lunch on a hill of black cypress.

Your fluted bones and acanthine hair are littered





In their old anarchy to the horizon-line.

It would take more than a lightning-stroke

To create such a ruin.

Nights, I squat in the cornucopia

Of your left ear, out of the wind,





Counting the red stars and those of plum-color.

The sun rises under the pillar of your tongue.

My hours are married to shadow.

No longer do I listen for the scrape of a keel

On the blank stones of the landing.





Lorelei





It is no night to drown in:

A full moon, river lapsing

Black beneath bland mirror-sheen,





The blue water-mists dropping

Scrim after scrim like fishnets

Though fishermen are sleeping,





The massive castle turrets

Doubling themselves in a glass

All stillness. Yet these shapes float





Up toward me, troubling the face

Of quiet. From the nadir

They rise, their limbs ponderous





With richness, hair heavier

Than sculpted marble. They sing

Of a world more full and clear





Than can be. Sisters, your song

Bears a burden too weighty

For the whorled ear’s listening





Here, in a well-steered country,

Under a balanced ruler.

Deranging by harmony





Beyond the mundane order,

Your voices lay siege. You lodge

On the pitched reefs of nightmare,





Promising sure harborage;

By day, descant from borders

Of hebetude, from the ledge





Also of high windows. Worse

Even than your maddening

Song, your silence. At the source





Of your ice-hearted calling—

Drunkenness of the great depths.

O river, I see drifting





Deep in your flux of silver

Those great goddesses of peace.

Stone, stone, ferry me down there.





Point Shirley





From Water-Tower Hill to the brick prison

The shingle booms, bickering under

The sea’s collapse.

Snowcakes break and welter. This year

The gritted wave leaps

The seawall and drops onto a bier

Of quahog chips,

Leaving a salty mash of ice to whiten





In my grandmother’s sand yard. She is dead,

Whose laundry snapped and froze here, who

Kept house against

What the sluttish, rutted sea could do.

Squall waves once danced

Ship timbers in through the cellar window;

A thresh-tailed, lanced

Shark littered in the geranium bed—





Such collusion of mulish elements

She wore her broom straws to the nub.

Twenty years out

Of her hand, the house still hugs in each drab

Stucco socket

The purple egg-stones: from Great Head’s knob

To the filled-in Gut

The sea in its cold gizzard ground those rounds.





Nobody wintering now behind

The planked-up windows where she set

Her wheat loaves

And apple cakes to cool. What is it

Survives, grieves

So, over this battered, obstinate spit

Of gravel? The waves’

Spewed relics clicker masses in the wind,





Grey waves the stub-necked eiders ride.

A labor of love, and that labor lost.

Steadily the sea

Eats at Point Shirley. She died blessed,

And I come by

Bones, bones only, pawed and tossed,

A dog-faced sea.

The sun sinks under Boston, bloody red.





I would get from these dry-papped stones

The milk your love instilled in them.

The black ducks dive.

And though your graciousness might stream,

And I contrive,

Grandmother, stones are nothing of home

To that spumiest dove.

Against both bar and tower the black sea runs.





The Bull of Bendylaw





The black bull bellowed before the sea.

The sea, till that day orderly,

Hove up against Bendylaw.





The queen in the mulberry arbor stared

Stiff as a queen on a playing card.

The king fingered his beard.





A blue sea, four horny bull-feet,

A bull-snouted sea that wouldn’t stay put,

Bucked at the garden gate.





Along box-lined walks in the florid sun

Toward the rowdy bellow and back again

The lords and ladies ran.





The great bronze gate began to crack,

The sea broke in at every crack,

Pellmell, blueblack.





The bull surged up, the bull surged down,

Not to be stayed by a daisy chain

Nor by any learned man.





O the king’s tidy acre is under the sea,

And the royal rose in the bull’s belly,

And the bull on the king’s highway.





All the Dead Dears





In the Archæological Museum in Cambridge is a stone coffin of the fourth century A.D. containing the skeletons of a woman, a mouse and a shrew. The ankle-bone of the woman has been slightly gnawn.





Rigged poker-stiff on her back

With a granite grin

This antique museum-cased lady

Lies, companioned by the gimcrack

Relics of a mouse and a shrew

That battened for a day on her ankle-bone.





These three, unmasked now, bear

Dry witness

To the gross eating game

We’d wink at if we didn’t hear

Stars grinding, crumb by crumb,

Our own grist down to its bony face.





How they grip us through thin and thick,

These barnacle dead!

This lady here’s no kin

Of mine, yet kin she is: she’ll suck

Blood and whistle my marrow clean

To prove it. As I think now of her head,





From the mercury-backed glass

Mother, grandmother, greatgrandmother

Reach hag hands to haul me in,

And an image looms under the fishpond surface

Where the daft father went down

With orange duck-feet winnowing his hair—





All the long gone darlings: they

Get back, though, soon,

Soon: be it by wakes, weddings,

Childbirths or a family barbecue:

Any touch, taste, tang’s

Fit for those outlaws to ride home on,





And to sanctuary: usurping the armchair

Between tick

And tack of the clock, until we go,

Each skulled-and-crossboned Gulliver

Riddled with ghosts, to lie

Deadlocked with them, taking root as cradles rock.





Aftermath





Compelled by calamity’s magnet

They loiter and stare as if the house

Burnt-out were theirs, or as if they thought

Some scandal might any minute ooze

From a smoke-choked closet into light;

No deaths, no prodigious injuries

Glut these hunters after an old meat,

Blood-spoor of the austere tragedies.





Mother Medea in a green smock

Moves humbly as any housewife through

Her ruined apartments, taking stock

Of charred shoes, the sodden upholstery:

Cheated of the pyre and the rack,

The crowd sucks her last tear and turns away.





The Thin People





They are always with us, the thin people

Meager of dimension as the grey people





On a movie-screen. They

Are unreal, we say:





It was only in a movie, it was only

In a war making evil headlines when we





Were small that they famished and

Grew so lean and would not round





Out their stalky limbs again though peace

Plumped the bellies of the mice





Under the meanest table.

It was during the long hunger-battle





They found their talent to persevere

In thinness, to come, later,





Into our bad dreams, their menace

Not guns, not abuses,





But a thin silence.

Wrapped in flea-ridden donkey skins,





Empty of complaint, forever

Drinking vinegar from tin cups: they wore





The insufferable nimbus of the lot-drawn

Scapegoat. But so thin,





So weedy a race could not remain in dreams,

Could not remain outlandish victims





In the contracted country of the head

Any more than the old woman in her mud hut could





Keep from cutting fat meat

Out of the side of the generous moon when it





Set foot nightly in her yard

Until her knife had pared





The moon to a rind of little light.

Now the thin people do not obliterate





Themselves as the dawn

Greyness blues, reddens, and the outline





Of the world comes clear and fills with color.

They persist in the sunlit room: the wallpaper





Frieze of cabbage-roses and cornflowers pales

Under their thin-lipped smiles,





Their withering kingship.

How they prop each other up!





We own no wildernesses rich and deep enough

For stronghold against their stiff





Battalions. See, how the tree boles flatten

And lose their good browns





If the thin people simply stand in the forest,

Making the world go thin as a wasp’s nest





And greyer; not even moving their bones.





Suicide Off Egg Rock





Behind him the hotdogs split and drizzled

On the public grills, and the ochreous salt flats,

Gas tanks, factory stacks—that landscape

Of imperfections his bowels were part of—

Rippled and pulsed in the glassy updraft.

Sun struck the water like a damnation.

No pit of shadow to crawl into,

And his blood beating the old tattoo

I am, I am, I am. Children

Were squealing where combers broke and the spindrift

Raveled wind-ripped from the crest of the wave.

A mongrel working his legs to a gallop

Hustled a gull flock to flap off the sandspit.





He smoldered, as if stone-deaf, blindfold,

His body beached with the sea’s garbage,

A machine to breathe and beat forever.

Flies filing in through a dead skate’s eyehole

Buzzed and assailed the vaulted brainchamber.

The words in his book wormed off the pages.

Everything glittered like blank paper.





Everything shrank in the sun’s corrosive

Ray but Egg Rock on the blue wastage.

He heard when he walked into the water





The forgetful surf creaming on those ledges.





Mushrooms





Overnight, very

Whitely, discreetly,

Very quietly





Our toes, our noses

Take hold on the loam,

Acquire the air.





Nobody sees us,

Stops us, betrays us;

The small grains make room.





Soft fists insist on

Heaving the needles,

The leafy bedding,





Even the paving.

Our hammers, our rams,

Earless and eyeless,





Perfectly voiceless,

Widen the crannies,

Shoulder through holes. We





Diet on water,

On crumbs of shadow,

Bland-mannered, asking





Little or nothing.

So many of us!

So many of us!





We are shelves, we are

Tables, we are meek,

We are edible,





Nudgers and shovers

In spite of ourselves.

Our kind multiplies:





We shall by morning

Inherit the earth.

Our foot’s in the door.





I Want, I Want





Open-mouthed, the baby god

Immense, bald, though baby-headed,

Cried out for the mother’s dug.

The dry volcanoes cracked and spit,





Sand abraded the milkless lip.

Cried then for the father’s blood

Who set wasp, wolf and shark to work,

Engineered the gannet’s beak.





Dry-eyed, the inveterate patriarch

Raised his men of skin and bone,

Barbs on the crown of gilded wire,

Thorns on the bloody rose-stem.





Watercolor of Grantchester Meadows





There, spring lambs jam the sheepfold. In air

Stilled, silvered as water in a glass

Nothing is big or far.

The small shrew chitters from its wilderness

Of grassheads and is heard.

Each thumb-size bird

Flits nimble-winged in thickets, and of good color.





Cloudrack and owl-hollowed willows slanting over

The bland Granta double their white and green

World under the sheer water

And ride that flux at anchor, upside down.

The punter sinks his pole.

In Byron’s pool

Cattails part where the tame cygnets steer.





It is a country on a nursery plate.

Spotted cows revolve their jaws and crop

Red clover or gnaw beetroot

Bellied on a nimbus of sun-glazed buttercup.

Hedging meadows of benign

Arcadian green

The blood-berried hawthorn hides its spines with white.





Droll, vegetarian, the water rat

Saws down a reed and swims from his limber grove,

While the students stroll or sit,

Hands laced, in a moony indolence of love—

Black-gowned, but unaware

How in such mild air

The owl shall stoop from his turret, the rat cry out.





The Ghost’s Leavetaking





Enter the chilly no-man’s land of about

Five o’clock in the morning, the no-color void

Where the waking head rubbishes out the draggled lot

Of sulfurous dreamscapes and obscure lunar conundrums

Which seemed, when dreamed, to mean so profoundly much,





Gets ready to face the ready-made creation

Of chairs and bureaus and sleep-twisted sheets.

This is the kingdom of the fading apparition,

The oracular ghost who dwindles on pin-legs

To a knot of laundry, with a classic bunch of sheets





Upraised, as a hand, emblematic of farewell.

At this joint between two worlds and two entirely

Incompatible modes of time, the raw material

Of our meat-and-potato thoughts assumes the nimbus

Of ambrosial revelation. And so departs.





Chair and bureau are the hieroglyphs

Of some godly utterance wakened heads ignore:

So these posed sheets, before they thin to nothing,

Speak in sign language of a lost otherworld,

A world we lose by merely waking up.





Trailing its telltale tatters only at the outermost

Fringe of mundane vision, this ghost goes

Hand aloft, goodbye, goodbye, not down

Into the rocky gizzard of the earth,

But toward a region where our thick atmosphere





Diminishes, and God knows what is there.

A point of exclamation marks that sky

In ringing orange like a stellar carrot.

Its round period, displaced and green,

Suspends beside it the first point, the starting





Point of Eden, next the new moon’s curve.

Go, ghost of our mother and father, ghost of us,

And ghost of our dreams’ children, in those sheets

Which signify our origin and end,

To the cloud-cuckoo land of color wheels





And pristine alphabets and cows that moo

And moo as they jump over moons as new

As that crisp cusp toward which you voyage now.

Hail and farewell. Hello, goodbye. O keeper

Of the profane grail, the dreaming skull.





A Winter Ship





At this wharf there are no grand landings to speak of.

Red and orange barges list and blister

Shackled to the dock, outmoded, gaudy,

And apparently indestructible.

The sea pulses under a skin of oil.





A gull holds his pose on a shanty ridgepole,

Riding the tide of the wind, steady

As wood and formal, in a jacket of ashes,

The whole flat harbor anchored in

The round of his yellow eye-button.





A blimp swims up like a day-moon or tin

Cigar over his rink of fishes.

The prospect is dull as an old etching.

They are unloading three barrels of little crabs.

The pier pilings seem about to collapse





And with them that rickety edifice

Of warehouses, derricks, smokestacks and bridges

In the distance. All around us the water slips

And gossips in its loose vernacular,

Ferrying the smells of dead cod and tar.





Farther out, the waves will be mouthing icecakes—

A poor month for park-sleepers and lovers.

Even our shadows are blue with cold.

We wanted to see the sun come up

And are met, instead, by this iceribbed ship,





Bearded and blown, an albatross of frost,

Relic of tough weather, every winch and stay

Encased in a glassy pellicle.

The sun will diminish it soon enough:

Each wave-tip glitters like a knife.





Full Fathom Five





Old man, you surface seldom.

Then you come in with the tide’s coming

When seas wash cold, foam-





Capped: white hair, white beard, far-flung,

A dragnet, rising, falling, as waves

Crest and trough. Miles long





Extend the radial sheaves

Of your spread hair, in which wrinkling skeins

Knotted, caught, survives





The old myth of origins

Unimaginable. You float near

As keeled ice-mountains





Of the north, to be steered clear

Of, not fathomed. All obscurity

Starts with a danger:





Your dangers are many. I

Cannot look much but your form suffers

Some strange injury





And seems to die: so vapors

Ravel to clearness on the dawn sea.

The muddy rumors





Of your burial move me

To half-believe: your reappearance

Proves rumors shallow,





For the archaic trenched lines

Of your grained face shed time in runnels:

Ages beat like rains





On the unbeaten channels

Of the ocean. Such sage humor and

Durance are whirlpools





To make away with the ground-

Work of the earth and the sky’s ridgepole.

Waist down, you may wind





One labyrinthine tangle

To root deep among knuckles, shin-bones,

Skulls. Inscrutable,





Below shoulders not once

Seen by any man who kept his head,

You defy questions;





You defy other godhood.

I walk dry on your kingdom’s border

Exiled to no good.





Your shelled bed I remember.

Father, this thick air is murderous.

I would breathe water.





Blue Moles





1


They’re out of the dark’s ragbag, these two

Moles dead in the pebbled rut,

Shapeless as flung gloves, a few feet apart—

Blue suede a dog or fox has chewed.

One, by himself, seemed pitiable enough,

Little victim unearthed by some large creature

From his orbit under the elm root.

The second carcass makes a duel of the affair:

Blind twins bitten by bad nature.





The sky’s far dome is sane and clear.

Leaves, undoing their yellow caves

Between the road and the lake water,

Bare no sinister spaces. Already

The moles look neutral as the stones.

Their corkscrew noses, their white hands

Uplifted, stiffen in a family pose.

Difficult to imagine how fury struck—

Dissolved now, smoke of an old war.





2


Nightly the battle-shouts start up

In the ear of the veteran, and again

I enter the soft pelt of the mole.

Light’s death to them: they shrivel in it.

They move through their mute rooms while I sleep,

Palming the earth aside, grubbers

After the fat children of root and rock.

By day, only the topsoil heaves.

Down there one is alone.





Outsize hands prepare a path,

They go before: opening the veins,

Delving for the appendages

Of beetles, sweetbreads, shards—to be eaten

Over and over. And still the heaven

Of final surfeit is just as far

From the door as ever. What happens between us

Happens in darkness, vanishes

Easy and often as each breath.





Strumpet Song





With white frost gone

And all green dreams not worth much,

After a lean day’s work

Time comes round for that foul slut:

Mere bruit of her takes our street

Until every man,

Red, pale or dark,

Veers to her slouch.





Mark, I cry, that mouth

Made to do violence on,

That seamed face

Askew with blotch, dint, scar

Struck by each dour year.

Walks there not some such one man

As can spare breath

To patch with brand of love this rank grimace

Which out from black tarn, ditch and cup

Into my most chaste own eyes

Looks up.





Man in Black





Where the three magenta

Breakwaters take the shove

And suck of the grey sea





To the left, and the wave

Unfists against the dun

Barb-wired headland of





The Deer Island prison

With its trim piggeries,

Hen huts and cattle green





To the right, and March ice

Glazes the rock pools yet,

Snuff-colored sand cliffs rise





Over a great stone spit

Bared by each falling tide,

And you, across those white





Stones, strode out in your dead

Black coat, black shoes, and your

Black hair till there you stood,





Fixed vortex on the far

Tip, riveting stones, air,

All of it, together.





Snakecharmer





As the gods began one world, and man another,

So the snakecharmer begins a snaky sphere

With moon-eye, mouth-pipe. He pipes. Pipes green. Pipes water.





Pipes water green until green waters waver

With reedy lengths and necks and undulatings.

And as his notes twine green, the green river





Shapes its images around his songs.

He pipes a place to stand on, but no rocks,

No floor: a wave of flickering grass tongues





Supports his foot. He pipes a world of snakes,

Of sways and coilings, from the snake-rooted bottom

Of his mind. And now nothing but snakes





Is visible. The snake-scales have become

Leaf, become eyelid; snake-bodies, bough, breast

Of tree and human. And he within this snakedom





Rules the writhings which make manifest

His snakehood and his might with pliant tunes

From his thin pipe. Out of this green nest





As out of Eden’s navel twist the lines

Of snaky generations: let there be snakes!

And snakes there were, are, will be—till yawns





Consume this piper and he tires of music

And pipes the world back to the simple fabric

Of snake-warp, snake-weft. Pipes the cloth of snakes





To a melting of green waters, till no snake

Shows its head, and those green waters back to

Water, to green, to nothing like a snake.

Puts up his pipe, and lids his moony eye.





The Hermit at Outermost House





Sky and sea, horizon-hinged

Tablets of blank blue, couldn’t,

Clapped shut, flatten this man out.





The great gods, Stone-Head, Claw-Foot,

Winded by much rock-bumping

And claw-threat, realized that.





For what, then, had they endured

Dourly the long hots and colds,

Those old despots, if he sat





Laugh-shaken on his doorsill,

Backbone unbendable as

Timbers of his upright hut?





Hard gods were there, nothing else.

Still he thumbed out something else.

Thumbed no stony, horny pot,





But a certain meaning green.

He withstood them, that hermit.

Rock-face, crab-claw verged on green.





Gulls mulled in the greenest light.





The Disquieting Muses





Mother, mother, what illbred aunt

Or what disfigured and unsightly

Cousin did you so unwisely keep

Unasked to my christening, that she

Sent these ladies in her stead

With heads like darning-eggs to nod

And nod and nod at foot and head

And at the left side of my crib?





Mother, who made to order stories

Of Mixie Blackshort the heroic bear,

Mother, whose witches always, always

Got baked into gingerbread, I wonder

Whether you saw them, whether you said

Words to rid me of those three ladies

Nodding by night around my bed,

Mouthless, eyeless, with stitched bald head.





In the hurricane, when father’s twelve

Study windows bellied in

Like bubbles about to break, you fed

My brother and me cookies and Ovaltine

And helped the two of us to choir:

“Thor is angry: boom boom boom!

Thor is angry: we don’t care!”

But those ladies broke the panes.





When on tiptoe the schoolgirls danced,

Blinking flashlights like fireflies

And singing the glowworm song, I could

Not lift a foot in the twinkle-dress

But, heavy-footed, stood aside

In the shadow cast by my dismal-headed

Godmothers, and you cried and cried:

And the shadow stretched, the lights went out.





Mother, you sent me to piano lessons

And praised my arabesques and trills

Although each teacher found my touch

Oddly wooden in spite of scales

And the hours of practicing, my ear

Tone-deaf and yes, unteachable.

I learned, I learned, I learned elsewhere,

From muses unhired by you, dear mother,





I woke one day to see you, mother,

Floating above me in bluest air

On a green balloon bright with a million

Flowers and bluebirds that never were

Never, never, found anywhere.

But the little planet bobbed away

Like a soap-bubble as you called: Come here!

And I faced my traveling companions.





Day now, night now, at head, side, feet,

They stand their vigil in gowns of stone,

Faces blank as the day I was born,

Their shadows long in the setting sun

That never brightens or goes down.

And this is the kingdom you bore me to,

Mother, mother. But no frown of mine

Will betray the company I keep.





Medallion





By the gate with star and moon

Worked into the peeled orange wood

The bronze snake lay in the sun





Inert as a shoelace; dead

But pliable still, his jaw

Unhinged and his grin crooked,





Tongue a rose-colored arrow.

Over my hand I hung him.

His little vermilion eye





Ignited with a glassed flame

As I turned him in the light;

When I split a rock one time





The garnet bits burned like that.

Dust dulled his back to ocher

The way sun ruins a trout.





Yet his belly kept its fire

Going under the chainmail,

The old jewels smoldering there





In each opaque belly-scale:

Sunset looked at through milk glass.

And I saw white maggots coil





Thin as pins in the dark bruise

Where his innards bulged as if

He were digesting a mouse.





Knifelike, he was chaste enough,

Pure death’s-metal. The yardman’s

Flung brick perfected his laugh.





The Companionable Ills





The nose-end that twitches, the old imperfections—

Tolerable now as moles on the face

Put up with until chagrin gives place

To a wry complaisance—





Dug in first as God’s spurs

To start the spirit out of the mud

It stabled in; long-used, became well-loved

Bedfellows of the spirit’s debauch, fond masters.





Moonrise





Grub-white mulberries redden among leaves.

I’ll go out and sit in white like they do,

Doing nothing. July’s juice rounds their nubs.





This park is fleshed with idiot petals.

White catalpa flowers tower, topple,

Cast a round white shadow in their dying.





A pigeon rudders down. Its fantail’s white.

Vocation enough: opening, shutting

White petals, white fantails, ten white fingers.





Enough for fingernails to make half-moons

Redden in white palms no labor reddens.

White bruises toward color, else collapses.





Berries redden. A body of whiteness

Rots, and smells of rot under its headstone

Though the body walk out in clean linen.





I smell that whiteness here, beneath the stones

Where small ants roll their eggs, where grubs fatten.

Death may whiten in sun or out of it.





Death whitens in the egg and out of it.

I can see no color for this whiteness.

White: it is a complexion of the mind.





I tire, imagining white Niagaras

Build up from a rock root, as fountains build

Against the weighty image of their fall.





Lucina, bony mother, laboring

Among the socketed white stars, your face

Of candor pares white flesh to the white bone,





Who drag our ancient father at the heel,

White-bearded, weary. The berries purple

And bleed. The white stomach may ripen yet.





Spinster





Now this particular girl

During a ceremonious April walk

With her latest suitor

Found herself, of a sudden, intolerably struck

By the birds’ irregular babel

And the leaves’ litter.





By this tumult afflicted, she

Observed her lover’s gestures unbalance the air,

His gait stray uneven

Through a rank wilderness of fern and flower.

She judged petals in disarray,

The whole season, sloven.





How she longed for winter then!—

Scrupulously austere in its order

Of white and black

Ice and rock, each sentiment within border,

And heart’s frosty discipline

Exact as a snowflake.





But here—a burgeoning

Unruly enough to pitch her five queenly wits

Into vulgar motley—

A treason not to be borne. Let idiots

Reel giddy in bedlam spring:

She withdrew neatly.





And round her house she set

Such a barricade of barb and check

Against mutinous weather

As no mere insurgent man could hope to break

With curse, fist, threat

Or love, either.





Frog Autumn





Summer grows old, cold-blooded mother.

The insects are scant, skinny.

In these palustral homes we only

Croak and wither.





Mornings dissipate in somnolence.

The sun brightens tardily

Among the pithless reeds. Flies fail us.

The fen sickens.





Frost drops even the spider. Clearly

The genius of plenitude

Houses himself elsewhere. Our folk thin

Lamentably.





Mussel Hunter at Rock Harbor





I came before the water-

Colorists came to get the

Good of the Cape light that scours

Sand grit to sided crystal

And buffs and sleeks the blunt hulls

Of the three fishing smacks beached

On the bank of the river’s





Backtracking tail. I’d come for

Free fish-bait: the blue mussels

Clumped like bulbs at the grass-root

Margin of the tidal pools.

Dawn tide stood dead low. I smelt

Mud stench, shell guts, gulls’ leavings;

Heard a queer crusty scrabble





Cease, and I neared the silenced

Edge of a cratered pool-bed.

The mussels hung dull blue and

Conspicuous, yet it seemed

A sly world’s hinges had swung

Shut against me. All held still.

Though I counted scant seconds,





Enough ages lapsed to win

Confidence of safe-conduct

In the wary otherworld

Eyeing me. Grass put forth claws;

Small mud knobs, nudged from under,

Displaced their domes as tiny

Knights might doff their casques. The crabs





Inched from their pygmy burrows

And from the trench-dug mud, all

Camouflaged in mottled mail

Of browns and greens. Each wore one

Claw swollen to a shield large

As itself—no fiddler’s arm

Grown Gargantuan by trade,





But grown grimly, and grimly

Borne, for a use beyond my

Guessing of it. Sibilant

Mass-motived hordes, they sidled

Out in a converging stream

Toward the pool-mouth, perhaps to

Meet the thin and sluggish thread





Of sea retracing its tide-

Way up the river-basin.

Or to avoid me. They moved

Obliquely with a dry-wet

Sound, with a glittery wisp

And trickle. Could they feel mud

Pleasurable under claws





As I could between bare toes?

That question ended it—I

Stood shut out, for once, for all,

Puzzling the passage of their

Absolutely alien

Order as I might puzzle

At the clear tail of Halley’s





Comet coolly giving my

Orbit the go-by, made known

By a family name it

Knew nothing of. So the crabs

Went about their business, which

Wasn’t fiddling, and I filled

A big handkerchief with blue





Mussels. From what the crabs saw,

If they could see, I was one

Two-legged mussel-picker.

High on the airy thatching

Of the dense grasses I found

The husk of a fiddler-crab,

Intact, strangely strayed above





His world of mud—green color

And innards bleached and blown off

Somewhere by much sun and wind;

There was no telling if he’d

Died recluse or suicide

Or headstrong Columbus crab.

The crab-face, etched and set there,





Grimaced as skulls grimace: it

Had an Oriental look,

A samurai death mask done

On a tiger tooth, less for

Art’s sake than God’s. Far from sea—

Where red-freckled crab-backs, claws

And whole crabs, dead, their soggy





Bellies pallid and upturned,

Perform their shambling waltzes

On the waves’ dissolving turn

And return, losing themselves

Bit by bit to their friendly

Element—this relic saved

Face, to face the bald-faced sun.





The Beekeeper’s Daughter





A garden of mouthings. Purple, scarlet-speckled, black

The great corollas dilate, peeling back their silks.

Their musk encroaches, circle after circle,

A well of scents almost too dense to breathe in.

Hieratical in your frock coat, maestro of the bees,

You move among the many-breasted hives,





My heart under your foot, sister of a stone.





Trumpet-throats open to the beaks of birds.

The Golden Rain Tree drips its powders down.

In these little boudoirs streaked with orange and red

The anthers nod their heads, potent as kings

To father dynasties. The air is rich.

Here is a queenship no mother can contest—





A fruit that’s death to taste: dark flesh, dark parings.





In burrows narrow as a finger, solitary bees

Keep house among the grasses. Kneeling down

I set my eye to a hole-mouth and meet an eye

Round, green, disconsolate as a tear.

Father, bridegroom, in this Easter egg

Under the coronal of sugar roses





The queen bee marries the winter of your year.





The Times Are Tidy





Unlucky the hero born

In this province of the stuck record

Where the most watchful cooks go jobless

And the mayor’s rôtisserie turns

Round of its own accord.





There’s no career in the venture

Of riding against the lizard,

Himself withered these latter-days

To leaf-size from lack of action:

History’s beaten the hazard.





The last crone got burnt up

More than eight decades back

With the love-hot herb, the talking cat,

But the children are better for it,

The cow milk’s cream an inch thick.





The Burnt-out Spa





An old beast ended in this place:





A monster of wood and rusty teeth.

Fire smelted his eyes to lumps

Of pale blue vitreous stuff, opaque

As resin drops oozed from pine bark.





The rafters and struts of his body wear

Their char of karakul still. I can’t tell

How long his carcass has foundered under

The rubbish of summers, the black-leaved falls.





Now little weeds insinuate

Soft suede tongues between his bones.

His armorplate, his toppled stones

Are an esplanade for crickets.





I pick and pry like a doctor or

Archæologist among

Iron entrails, enamel bowls,

The coils and pipes that made him run.





The small dell eats what ate it once.

And yet the ichor of the spring

Proceeds clear as it ever did

From the broken throat, the marshy lip.





It flows off below the green and white

Balustrade of a sag-backed bridge.

Leaning over, I encounter one

Blue and improbable person





Framed in a basketwork of cattails.

O she is gracious and austere,

Seated beneath the toneless water!

It is not I, it is not I.





No animal spoils on her green door-step.

And we shall never enter there

Where the durable ones keep house.

The stream that hustles us





Neither nourishes nor heals.





Sculptor





FOR LEONARD BASKIN


To his house the bodiless

Come to barter endlessly

Vision, wisdom, for bodies

Palpable as his, and weighty.





Hands moving move priestlier

Than priest’s hands, invoke no vain

Images of light and air

But sure stations in bronze, wood, stone.





Obdurate, in dense-grained wood,

A bald angel blocks and shapes

The flimsy light; arms folded

Watches his cumbrous world eclipse





Inane worlds of wind and cloud.

Bronze dead dominate the floor,

Resistive, ruddy-bodied,

Dwarfing us. Our bodies flicker





Toward extinction in those eyes

Which, without him, were beggared

Of place, time, and their bodies.

Emulous spirits make discord,





Try entry, enter nightmares

Until his chisel bequeaths

Them life livelier than ours,

A solider repose than death’s.





Flute Notes from a Reedy Pond





Now coldness comes sifting down, layer after layer,

To our bower at the lily root.

Overhead the old umbrellas of summer

Wither like pithless hands. There is little shelter.





Hourly the eye of the sky enlarges its blank

Dominion. The stars are no nearer.

Already frog-mouth and fish-mouth drink

The liquor of indolence, and all things sink





Into a soft caul of forgetfulness.

The fugitive colors die.

Caddis worms drowse in their silk cases,

The lamp-headed nymphs are nodding to sleep like statues.





Puppets, loosed from the strings of the puppet-master,

Wear masks of horn to bed.

This is not death, it is something safer.

The wingy myths won’t tug at us any more:





The molts are tongueless that sang from above the water

Of golgotha at the tip of a reed,

And how a god flimsy as a baby’s finger

Shall unhusk himself and steer into the air.





The Stones





This is the city where men are mended.

I lie on a great anvil.

The flat blue sky-circle





Flew off like the hat of a doll

When I fell out of the light. I entered

The stomach of indifference, the wordless cupboard.





The mother of pestles diminished me.

I became a still pebble.

The stones of the belly were peaceable,





The head-stone quiet, jostled by nothing.

Only the mouth-hole piped out,

Importunate cricket





In a quarry of silences.

The people of the city heard it.

They hunted the stones, taciturn and separate,





The mouth-hole crying their locations.

Drunk as a fetus

I suck at the paps of darkness.





The food tubes embrace me. Sponges kiss my lichens away.

The jewelmaster drives his chisel to pry

Open one stone eye.





This is the after-hell: I see the light.

A wind unstoppers the chamber

Of the ear, old worrier.





Water mollifies the flint lip,

And daylight lays its sameness on the wall.

The grafters are cheerful,





Heating the pincers, hoisting the delicate hammers.

A current agitates the wires

Volt upon volt. Catgut stitches my fissures.





A workman walks by carrying a pink torso.

The storerooms are full of hearts.

This is the city of spare parts.





My swaddled legs and arms smell sweet as rubber.

Here they can doctor heads, or any limb.

On Fridays the little children come





To trade their hooks for hands.

Dead men leave eyes for others.

Love is the uniform of my bald nurse.





Love is the bone and sinew of my curse.

The vase, reconstructed, houses

The elusive rose.





Ten fingers shape a bowl for shadows.

My mendings itch. There is nothing to do.

I shall be good as new.
